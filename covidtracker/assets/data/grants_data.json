Our services include. Transport to and from peoples homes, as well as transport to other health care appointments on the days they attend The Centre. A daily shopping service. A bathing service, especially beneficial to the more frail members and also their family carers. A daily seated exercise class which benefits physical and mental well being. A 2 course freshly cooked lunch and beverages throughout the day. Other activities include, board & card games, quizzes, Bingo, debates, showing of old movies, speakers, entertainers, and trips out to various places of interest. The Centre also has a visiting chiropodist helping to ensure good foot care without the stress of attending a clinic. Our strategy is to work from a comprehensive range of information between, ourselves, the members and other health organisations.",

Our aim is to help prevent homelessness with early intervention as well as helping people overcome homelessness for good. Everything we do is geared towards helping people move away from homelessness permanently, enabling them to lead happy, independent and fulfilling lives within the community. We support over 1,200 people on average every year and as the amount of people affected by homelessness grows so does the demand for our services. At HARP, we are always looking at new ways to help people get off the streets - and stay off the streets. The number of bed spaces we are able to offer has grown, as part of HARP\u2019s response to the growing need in the town, from 174 in mid-2018 to 214 today, plus additional sleeping spaces in our Extended Emergency Service - an overnight shelter at our Bradbury Centre for those in immediate need. we have always emphasised that rough sleeping is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of overall levels of homelessness. Although this is the most visible and dangerous aspect, there are countless more people in precarious accommodation, sofa-surfing, or staying in temporary housing who need ongoing support to avoid and overcome homelessness. And new people are finding themselves in these precarious and often dangerous circumstances every day.Nearly half of the people who came to HARP for help in 2019 were using our services for the first time, and over half of those new visitors were sofa surfing, had no fixed abode, or were at risk of losing their accommodation and were in need of help and support to keep it. This only goes to show how many local people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and are in danger of ending up on the streets. We desperately need more social housing and affordable accommodation (and this means properties to rent, not just \u201caffordable housing\u201d for people fortunate enough to be able to purchase), as well as better support for people struggling with their financial and housing situations, and a genuine effort to tackle the root causes of homelessness.",

In addition we also host the districts Volunteer Centre and other projects that support people with Maldon District to be more involved with their community. At the current time these projects include - The Essex Shed Network: after successfully launching the Maldon Shed in 2014 Maldon and District CVS were approached by other districts to support them to set up similar projects. Men in Shed projects provide community spaces with a focus on practical activities such as woodwork. These spaces enable local men to build friendships and gain/offer peer support which has the ultimate outcome of improving social connections and decreasing feelings of loneliness. The Essex Shed Network provides support, information and networking opportunities to people involved with or wishing to be involved with Men in Shed projects - Blokes: - spinning off from the Essex Shed Network we are working in partnership with Active Maldon to facilitate local men having support to access existing local services and activities that have positive health outcomes such as walking football or weight management schemes. - Southminster Patio Project: - working with the Memorial Hall in Southminster we are setting up a community gardening space at the rear of their project to enhance the Memorial Halls offer as a community hub for Southminster and to have wellbeing outcomes for local people - Harbour: - running for ten years this project provides social support to local people who are a risk of social isolation. As a weekly coffee morning it offers access to Connect Well social prescribing and wellbeing activities such as gardening, singing and crafts as well as the opportunity to make friendships. - Wellbeing walks: Weekly walks at Maldon Prom Park to encourage people to walk socially as a first step to healthier lives. - The Maldon Active Support Team: this project add value to all the above and the wider sector through the Volunteer Centre and other contacts. Working in a person centred way the project provides bespoke one to one support to people who have barriers to community involvement such as mental health conditions, physical disabilities, low income or low confidence. The Coordinator works with them to explore options they may be interested in and facilitate their involvement, this includes help with form filling, accompanied visits, adaption of opportunities and ongoing support. The MAST project also hosts some small group activities as tasters for community involvement, these are being merged with some of the above projects as the MAST project comes to an end in December 2018 and we are working as an organisation to preserving the legacy of the project.",

In addition to our minibus services we offer a bespoke car service run by volunteer car drivers in their own cars. This service is tailored to the individual and volunteers are able to assist passengers with shopping or sit with them at medical appointments or support groups.

The Swinemoor Estate is in the top 15% of multiple deprivation in the country. At the heart of the work of the centre is its advice service, which has provided thousands of individuals from Beverley and the East Riding of Yorkshire with a safe, confidential environment where they can receive guidance and support on a wide range of issues including debt, housing, benefits, homelessness, domestic violence, and legal issues. The Centre also aims to address the poverty and social isolation in the community. Many of the local families are reliant on the Centre for food vouchers for the East Yorkshire Foodbank due to low income. The Centre offers a Youth Group, a Women\u2019s Group, a pensioners\u2019 group. a support group for Stroke survivors and their carers, various other community groups, and is an agent for the regional Credit Union.

This enables our users to become more independent and socially active, thus, creating a healthier lifestyle for those using the Goole GoFar service. Goole GoFar initially provided services for the elderly, and apart from school contracts, we very rarely offered young people and children any form of transport. However, we now offer a range of services for our elderly members, as well, as low income families, young people and children.

It remains an independent charity, predominately working in rural Thirsk and surrounding rural areas. We \u201csupport people in North Yorkshire to engage with and contribute to their community\u201d. The merger has achieved the ambition to have a single point of contact for children, young people, adults and older people who need to access support or a service. We can now provide a truly holistic service, not only to the individual but to the family. We are also providing support to other local charities. Our aim is to facilitate partnerships to support people in North Yorkshire, particularly from Thirsk to connect with and contribute to their community by providing opportunities for them to improve their economic, health and social wellbeing. We have four objectives: Increase Social Inclusion\u2013 We want our communities to be more socially included. Over the next three years our work will help more of our members to belong, join in, and contribute to community life. Fewer people will feel isolated and will have taken up opportunities to make and sustain friendships. More members will have moved on to join other local community groups with our support and taken part in \u2018giving back\u2019 activities that have grown their feelings of community belonging. As part of this we will have delivered focused pieces of work supporting people with mental health problems, older people, unemployed young people, and people with long-term ill health.",

Our costs of providing accommodation are covered by our working arrangement with the City of York Council, but it is by offering an extra level of support that we are able to engage with residents, help them get to the root cause of their homelessness and help them to move forward in their lives, with the ultimate aim of them moving into unsupported accommodation and commit to regular employment. This extra support has to be funded by grants, fundraising events and regular donations. The number of referrals we receive from other agencies ( such as The Probation Service, City of York Council, the Salvation Army and various homeless hostels etc ) has continued to rise. Our residents have a variety of issues, often a combination of mental health issues, physical health issues and addictions and many have previously found themselves in prison. All are unemployed and homeless when they are first referred to us.",

We employ qualified and dedicated Social Workers & Counsellors to deliver a caring professional service, which is structured and intensive where necessary. Our unique approach is to intervene a soon as problems are identified and work with the children for a long as it takes to put things right. Mental health problems affect about 1 in 10 children or young people and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives. Without effective intervention, these conditions can have a significant impact on their life chances. Our experienced mental health professionals not only support the child through one to one counselling sessions but also, by conducting thorough assessments are able to provide expert advice and support to both school staff, parents and families. The majority of children we help come to us, or are referred to us through their school and it is a fact that a child with emotional and behavioural problems can often cause disruption in a classroom and generally hinder their own learning and that of the other children in the class. Through our intervention we are able to offer support to the child or young person, their families as well as both the school and their staff.",

We support small group development in many different ways including constitutions, policies, becoming fit for grant funding, improving branding and marketing, finding funding.

Liaison with loan companies to ensure clients are being treated fairly. We also mediate between private landlords and tenants to resolve disagreements before any situation goes beyond redemption. Full assistance with disability issues and completion of Personal Independence Payment (PIP), children's Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance (AA) forms, mandatory reconsiderations and appeals. Whilst not a foodbank we provide and have done for over 13 years , sets of parcels of food and toiletries, loo rolls, baby essentials including nappies, household goods and cleaning liquids to those in an emergency need situation - issued on production of a written referral only from an agency. Staff have the authority to provide goods if necessary. These goods are all donated by churches and other faith organisations, schools and the general public and local businesses. Via a CVS Winter Warmth Grant we provide top ups for gas and electricity meters, in emergency only. We also help with the purchase of uniform for children in an impoverished family situation; these funds are donated to us specifically. We give out tents, airbeds, sleeping bags and chairs to those sleeping rough on the streets and in vehicles; donated via V Festival Clearance and Lighthouse Furniture Project. Also duvets, bedding and towels are provided to those in need once a tenancy has been arranged and where they have no funds to buy such items having paid out deposits and rent in advance to secure a home. We give out what comes in by way of donations as many individuals and agencies both statutory, nonstatutory, voluntary sector, local businesses such as Co-op, Johnsons, Howdens Joinery, Pipetech, individuals, churches and faith organisations give to the Centre. We operate a subsidised canteen serving hot and cold drinks and cold snacks at incredibly cheap prices. Specific Universal Credit assistance is provided, especially with online application and set up and then ongoing via a claimant's journal. Often clients are not able or have the wherewithal or access to a computer for this type of benefit take up and regularly we see people in obvious distress concerning this situation. We are experienced in helping and supporting claimants in enabling access to in order fulfil the requirements of the benefit itself. This is an essential and valuable service and extremely time consuming as more and more folk are being transferred over to UC and then are panicking about application and budgeting the new type of payment. This help was requested by local claimants and by the Job Centre Plus office as they are unable to assist directly with a claim or a setup of a UC account.",

Our core work is a Home-Start model of which independent research found 3 years after support ended both parent and child outcomes continued. Volunteers play an important role and offer the assistance of another person to provide both emotional and practical mentoring support in supervised role. Alongside this core work we identify need and pop up innovative projects in response.

All our Touch to See books contain colour references encouraging interaction between blind people and the sighted people around them, breaking down the barriers that create social exclusion. Our aim is that everything we do, from creating Touch to See Books, through our online presence extending the content of our books, to our community Book Clubs, is designed to be shared, in order to integrate blind people with the sighted community around them. Our library meets all needs with its continually growing and extensive catalogue of Touch to See book titles. We provide for our littlest readers with the Pre-School Learning Library, with adaptations of the popular illustrated story books such as \u2018Spot\u2019 and \u2018Peppa Pig.\u2019 The purpose of this application is to enable us to continue to support 153 blind and partially sighted children and young people living in Somerset by providing them with unlimited loans from our growing collection of unique Touch to See books, designed to engage, entertain and educate.",

We weigh collections and update the Trussel trust data management system with the weights and info regarding the clients we supply food to for their national statistics. We manage the accounts of any monetary donations and pay the overheads of running the warehouse. The acoounts are independently audited every year. We rely totally on volunteers who keep the Foodbank open twice a week for 2 hours at a time and adhere to all health and safety requirements and any Trussel Trust recommendations. We are endeavouring to increase our profile through marketing , word of mouth and some press releases but still have a long way to go on this.",

                    "description": "We are a small charity set up to offer low cost counselling, educational workshops and community projects for the residents of our local community in Sedgemoor, with our headquarters based in Burnham-on-Sea. Somewhere House Somerset was born from the recognition that therapeutic services are not easily accessible to disadvantaged people. Cuts in government funding of mental health services has resulted in long waiting lists (with some waiting up to a year for an appointment). High costs to access private therapy means people on lower incomes are unable to seek support outside the NHS; this leaves individuals suffering alone and in distress. We aim to provide affordable therapy that is accessible to all ethnicities. What makes our services stand out, is that we ask our clients to pay what they can afford towards the cost of their counselling sessions. Our therapist are fully qualified and are members or accredited with BACP (British Association of Counselling Professionals). We follow BACP guidelines and ethics. Our counsellors meet local residents, children and young people, families, parents and lone parents, LGBTQ, victims of crime, violence and abuse, older people, individuals living in poverty, long-term unemployed, people with alcohol and substances misuse and addiction. The individuals we work with feel alone, misunderstood and not heard. They struggle with self-identity, masking their true feelings and experience difficulties in expressing themselves. Issues we help with are mental health difficulties, abuse, trauma, eating disorders, bereavement, anxiety, depression, loneliness, suicidal ideation, stress, bullying, PTSD, family dysfunction, relationship problems, parenting difficulties, substances and alcohol misuse. Our counsellors work to a person-centred approach, helping individuals perceive themselves more consciously whilst working towards meeting their full potential. The clients can talk through deeply personal feelings, find a different perspective and tools to manage difficult emotions; setting new goals and having the confidence to achieve them. Our charity also offers educational workshops. We saw a huge success and growth in 2018/19 for our interactive workshops that we run in schools and colleges; raising awareness on the risk of substances misuse and alcohol. We are fortunate to have volunteers who give their time freely, sharing deeply personal accounts of their lives in addiction, highlighting consequences and the damage caused to themselves, their families, friends and loved ones. Our aim is to pass the right information, so children and young people can make informed choices that are based in facts. Somewhere House Somerset also provides community projects. We believe that each person we support should have opportunities to develop relationships, learn new things and enjoy the activities they wish to do, we create supportive environments for the community and this is why we run community projects. We promote choice and inclusion and shape a service that is individual as they are. Becoming part of the local community enables individuals to live an active and inclusive life. Right now, we have a 5-a-side footie league that get together and have fun every Monday night. We run coffee mornings on a monthly basis and pub quiz every 6 months. The most important aspect of our work is that we bring long-term emotional, mental wellbeing and safety for the individuals we counsel. The work we conduct allows people to become more aware of the choices they make, resulting in creating greater awareness of the impact their behaviour has on each other, their friends, family and love ones. We have testimonials from clients that have used our service that can be evidenced upon request.",

Our consultation found that there was demand for a community centre. In order to address this finding and secure investment, Wilstockhub was founded as a Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG) with no share capital on 29 April 15. \u2022 Following its founding, Wilstockhub Trustees commissioned \u2018Locality\u2019, the national membership network for community organisations, to independently consult residents, assess needs and determine attendant cost and risk. Locality confirmed the demand for a community centre was the community\u2019s priority \u2013 a place all ages can meet and socialise, enjoy recreation and culture, and young residents can benefit from early years education. \u2022 To further its aims Wilstockhub became a registered charity on 22 June 2018. Its charitable objects benefit residents through its association with them, local authorities, voluntary and other organisations by advancing education and providing social welfare, recreation and leisure facilities for all residents. \u2022 Six trustees exercise collective governance, oversight and management of the CLG and registered charity which is Wilstockhub. Building Wilstockhub is a two phase project. Phase 1 will found the communal community space.

                    "description": "ACSOS offers a friendship/befriending service for older adults; a low cost transport service (driver mileage reimbursement only) which offers lifts to and from medical appointments, shopping, day centres/clubs and visits to loved ones in hospital/homes, a \u2018handyman\u2019 service to provide assistance with small repairs along with information, wheelchair hire, hearing aid battery replacement, advice and signposting to other services and agencies. The friendship/befriending service seeks to provide comfort, friendship and practical help to residents in the borough of Southend-on-Sea and in Castle Point and Rochford who feel isolated or who need support in maintaining the lifestyle they wish to lead. In addition to providing company, weekly visits or telephone calls also enable the volunteer to monitor the well-being of the person being visited/called (the \"visitee\"). This is an invaluable service in that any signs of deterioration in the health of the visitee can be reported to the appropriate authority at the earliest possible stage. ACSOS currently befriends c.300 older people. The transport service provided by ACSOS has grown substantially over the past 5 years from c.600 lifts in 2013 to over 4,000 lifts in the past year. ACSOS receives no funding for this service, the only charge being a mileage charge of 47p per mile paid directly to our volunteer drivers. ACSOS has recently merged with Club 50+ CIO (reg. no. 1152184). The club provides health promoting activities such as tai chi, yoga and \u201ckeep fit\u201d classes as well as table tennis, short mat bowls, snooker and darts. It also provides line, modern ballroom, sequence and belly dancing tuition and offers lessons to help older people to improve their computer literacy and understand how to use the internet. Members can also play whist and bridge and there are facilities for them to develop skills in arts and crafts. As, due to age, many of its members are not as fit and active as they used to be the club tries to tailor its classes to meet their specific needs. For those that are less active and just want company, the club also has a \u201ctea bar\u201d where members can buy hot or cold drinks and light snacks. As most of its members are pensioners and many are on low incomes, the club has endeavoured to keep its charges as low as possible while trying to ensure that it can pay its bills. For example, charges for tutor-led activities (\u00a32.50 per session) and \u201ctea bar\u201d charges (50p for a cup of tea) are lower than those charged by most other activity clubs or cafes. These activities are much needed as, compared to the national average, Southend has: * a higher than average number of people over 65; * a higher percentage of older people living in deprivation; and * significantly more older people who live alone. Older adults in Southend on Sea are also 2.5% more likely to suffer with multiple long term health conditions than the rest of the UK. ACSOS has recently obtained planning permission from Southend Borough Council to convert the Grade II listed, Havens department store in Westcliff-on-Sea into a \"one-stop\" centre housing all of the facilities and services need by the older people of Southend and surrounding areas.The community hub is located in an area of Southend that houses a significant percentage of the older residents of the Borough many of whom are on low incomes. The hub will house not only ACSOS but also other local charities such as advocacy, bereavement support and services for those suffering from dementia. It will also house rooms for public health and social services and provide older people with chiropody, hairdressing and beauty treatment services. The hub will also include a caf\u00e9 which will offer hot and cold meals and drinks at a reasonable cost throughout the day and will be open to anyone. Club 50+, which has over 200 members, will be relocated to the first floor of hub from its current premises in Queens Road, Southend that is being converted into flats at the beginning of 2019. The hub will offer a range of regular \u2018pop up\u2019 services delivered by the Police, Fire Service, Peabody, Alzheimers Society and any other local organizations and charities who can offer services or information appropriate for the service users. There will be a number of opportunities for the sharing of experience and skills through inter-generational activities, for example, a \u201cMen's Shed\u201d will be in situ at the Hub which will offer people (both men and women) the chance to develop woodworking and metal working skills.",

What we intend to do to help make this happen (Our Aims) The prevention or relief of poverty in Colchester and the surrounding area, in particular, but not exclusively, by providing emergency food supplies to individuals in need and/or charities or other organisations working to prevent or relieve poverty. What we do (Our Mission) The Foodbank exists to prevent or relieve poverty in Colchester and the surrounding area, in particular, but not exclusively, by providing emergency food supplies to individuals with assessed short-term need and/or to charities or other organisations working towards the same aims. How we help (Delivering for the common good /public benefit) Colchester Foodbank provides short-term emergency support to individuals and families in a crisis within Colchester and the surrounding area, including Brightlingsea. We also work with other local food banks and regularly review our areas of coverage in response to need. To qualify for help, families and individuals must be referred by a professional from a partner organisation, such as Social Services, One Support, Community Mental Health Team, local housing groups, Citizens Advice Bureau and Age UK. We also work with Churches, Schools, GP Surgeries, philanthropic individuals and businesses. The need for referral to Colchester Foodbank is usually caused by a complex combination of events that may include factors like benefits delays, unemployment, illness and domestic violence. Where possible we refer or signpost people to relevant agencies, so they can get the additional help they need. This enables them to more fully understand the reality of their issues and how to get through them, seeking appropriate support and targeted transitional intervention. Also for us, to be able to monitor our longer term social impact. The way we behave while doing what we do (Our values) Colchester Foodbank is committed to community built on diversity, tolerance, cooperation, and mutual respect; we want to contribute to society and demonstrate social responsibility. Our values are important to us, and we aim to live them out in all areas of our work. We are passionate about what we do and the difference it makes in the lives of others We are compassionate; we give selflessly and put others before ourselves We hold ourselves accountable: we acknowledge and assume responsibility for actions, decisions, and consequences \u2013 as individuals and as an organisation. We are innovative, with the ambition to pursue new and creative ideas that have the potential to change lives for the better. We empower and encourage staff, volunteers and clients to take the initiative and achieve their best, in a safe environment where mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities. We provide three days\u2019 nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. Our emergency three day food parcels contain: Tinned soup; beans; vegetables; fish; & Meat; pasta, rice & spaghetti; cook-in sauces; Cereals; long-life milk; sugar; tea and coffee; fruit juices/squash; biscuits; jams; tinned fruit and puddings.

We provide a small number of homeless parcels which include food items that don\u2019t require a kitchen including just add hot water packets (pot noodles/ porridge), ring pulled tins (fruit, ham, corned beef) our main partner agency in distributing these is Beacon House. Our parcels are generically made up but we then work with each client, to make them bespoke to their personal needs. Be it food that doesn\u2019t require cooking, gluten free, Kosher, Halal, vegetarian, vegan, apescatarian or if they just don\u2019t like something in particular we will remove it from the parcel and try to exchange it. We provide information about our services to school assemblies, voluntary organisations and at events. We offer guided tours and talks to scouts, schools and other interested parties. Between August 2016 and July 2017 the Foodbank provided 743 family parcels and 1879 standard parcels. This fed 6090 people, of which 3478 were adults and 2612 were children. We provide well over 200 emergency food parcels every month, feeding about 500 people every month. We also provide ingredients to support the charity food 4 kids, so they can bake cakes for children's birthdays. Two years ago, we provided individuals and families in crisis with three day emergency food parcels, specifically to support 4,919 people. Last year the demand for our service increased by 342, so we fed 5,261 people. This year, demand has increased by a further 507 people, so we fed 5,768 people.",

                    "description": "Rainbow Services (Harlow) is a local charity which acts as the infrastructure support services provider for the VCSE across Harlow with extensive networks across communities, businesses and voluntary sector organisations and delivers several community projects with vulnerable and disadvantaged communities in the town, including older residents, those living in the Permitted Housing developments, young people at risk of crime and gangs, offenders, and vulnerable communities: - Rainbow Services provides infrastructure support to local voluntary and community groups, holding regular meetings, workshops and publishing a weekly e-bulletin sharing information on subjects relevant to the sector. As part of this role we also encourage the forming of partnerships and collaborative working across Harlow and the wider voluntary sector. We currently co-ordinate 3 partnerships of statutory, private, and VCSE organisations working together to identify solutions to some of the most pressing problems facing communities within Harlow (Permitted Housing Developments; youth and anti-social behaviour; worklessness). We also work closely with Harlow Volunteer Centre and catalyse volunteering across Harlow. This includes through providing direct support to the Tempo Time Credits scheme, promoting it across communities and enabling our affiliates to sign up, providing training sessions and one off volunteering opportunities to earn Time Credits. - Rainbow Services provides direct services to the local community via our Community Builder project, which is currently supporting local older residents to identify and utilise personal and community assets to reduce social isolation and loneliness. We now support this programme across West Essex. We have also introduced a digital element to this and we are providing Digital Buddies to older residents to help them use technological solutions to maintain their independence and social networks. - Our Business Engagement project is working to facilitate a more structured approach to Corporate Social Responsibility and to create a better pipeline for business involvement and volunteering opportunities with the wider Voluntary Sector and local community. - Our Recycling Workshop currently offers 2 projects: the first is a contracted arrangement (with Sodexo) to provide a workplace environment for offenders who have received a community service order through the courts in an environment that is, whilst punitive, also rehabilitative and constructive. This project is the only community and voluntary sector run programme which Sodexo offers in Essex and is creating real opportunities for offenders to give back to their community by building and refurbishing items for local groups and organisations, whilst developing transferable skills which could lead to more positive activities on completion of their order. Service users from this project are involved in a new community venture with St Clare Hospice, upcycling donated furniture for resale in their stores across the region. The second project currently running from the workshop is for young people aged 14 - 18 who are disengaging from school and society and are at risk of crime, violence, gangs, drugs and anti-social behaviour. We offer supported positive activity sessions each week for up to 40 young people each year and accept referrals of from local schools, youth services, the local Community Safety Team and the Youth Offending team. The sessions provide positive, skills based activities supported by adults who have been screened and trained to help the young people learn new skills and positive behaviours through focused, mentored activity for 6 - 8 weeks. We act as a Hub for Youthbuild Essex in delivering 2 Gateway qualifications which young people can work towards. The young people make items for both themselves/their family (enabling them to develop self-esteem and showcase their achievements) and for local community projects for example bird and bat boxes for the local nature reserve (which they then put up and which they can take friend and family to see, developing self-worth and sense of community belonging). Rainbow has a well established reputation for delivering local projects individually and in partnership with others. Rainbow Services is the partner of choice for Harlow District Council and West Essex CCG in matters of community development and consultation, and we are currently supporting Essex Count Council to trial new methods of consultation with a pilot in Harlow. We have been asked by Harlow Council to co-ordinate a consultation into diverse communities.",

                    "description": "Street Pastors (SP) was introduce to provide a reassuring presence in the local communities. The whole ethos of SP is to listen, care, help and to engage with not only those who are out enjoying themselves within the night-time economy but also those who have found themselves in difficulties. We are trained volunteers from local churches who care about our community. We patrol in teams in town centres usually from 9pm to 2am on a Friday and/or Saturday night offering a helping hand to those who are in need on the streets. We seek to discourage anti-social behaviour by way of being a presence on the streets. This in turn decreases unnecessary call-outs to the emergency services allowing their time to be utilised elsewhere. We provide practical help, which includes handing out flip-flops to those in need, give out free bottled water and lollipops (which surprisingly has a way a diffusing potential altercations). We assist the homeless and rough sleepers with clothes, refreshments, sleeping bags or space blankets. We are called upon by some Councils and the Police to set up in areas which require our input. Alongside SP, new initiatives like Schools Pastors, Rail Pastors and Response Pastors which deal with major incidents assisting the Police and the emergency services/agencies are taking place throughout Essex and other areas. A number of our activities include, signposting individuals and those seeking help and advice to local support services and agencies. We take part in fundraising events to continue the work we are doing and to support those in need. We attend and are invited to various events/meetings run by the Council, the Voluntary sector, Police, Charities, local companies and organisations, we then provide awareness of the services we offer. Billericay Street Pastors (SP) was launched November 2013. We run and take part in outreach events at Summerfest, Soap Box Derby, Remembrance Day and the Christmas Markets. The Coordinator has regular meetings with the Police, Councils and other agencies tackling lower crime and making communities safer. We patrol twice a week on Fridays and Saturdays. We have built up strong links with the night time economy venue owners as a way of information sharing/gathering. Basildon Street Pastors - Launched August 2016. With the support of local Councillors, we were able to open a office space and we are also looking to provide a community hub in the Town Centre to facilitate various groups and offer a drop-in centre. It will signpost individuals/families to supportive services, alleviate suffering, help combat loneliness, homelessness and those disenfranchised from the community. We have had the opportunity of running an outreach tent as part of the 'Love your Borough Day' in Basildon Town centre and also Basildon MAYFEST. These are crucial events to heighten awareness of Street Pastors to different communities informing them we are here to help them. Southend Street Pastors - We attend public meetings which includes Love Southend events, Community in Harmony and the Faith Forum at the Civic Centre. The Coordinator also attends the Purple Flag meetings. Southend is one of the recipients of the Purple Flag, given by the Association of Town Centre Management. The scheme, similar to the Blue Flag for beaches, praised the town's high street and seafront for being \"welcoming, safe and clean\" and recipient of the Queens Award in 2015. Response Pastors - Our Response Pastors are active on the national database to respond to national crisis impacting our communities. Twelve are from Essex who work with the Police. Schools Pastors - This is to supply pastoral care within local Secondary schools. Links are well under way with 3 Projects. Two of these launched in 2018 at Billericay School and William De Ferrers school at South Woodham Ferrers. Cecil Jones School, Eastwood and Becket Keys in Brentwood are also in early stages of acceptance. This is a joint scheme between Schools Pastors, Council, Police, Church and other schools. Schools Pastors also assist with being a presence on routes home after school to discourage bullying and anti-social behaviour. Rail Pastors - This is the newly formed Project with research and ground work already carried out by the Coordinator which in turn has formed relationships with all interested parties along the C2C line and now the Abellio East Anglia in Essex. The Coordinator attends the Police and Communities Together (PACT) and route Crime monthly meetings. Preliminary meetings have taken place with C2C, Abellio East Anglia, Network Rail and British Transport Police (BTP) to secure a working framework and joined up services to support the work of this local Project. In-house Training - We have trained 24 Response Pastors, some of who have since be deployed nationwide to support communities with major incidents. We carry out county-wide recruitment and shared training sessions for newcomers, refresher training thus creating value for money. Regular meetings - These take place with the 12 Initiatives based in Essex at Police HQ to share best practices and being debriefed on current activities. To keep abreast of current trends, community/service knowledge and information sharing, a number of meetings are attended which is paramount to the continuation of providing an informative service to our communities and the public: Strategic Independent Advisory Group (SIAG) \u2013 The Coordinator is an active member of the SIAG and now the local Basildon IAG rep. These groups meet at Police HQ to monitor and advise the police on their community activity. The Coordinator has been active at the SIAG for nearly a year and will continue to be part of this group whilst funding allows. Emergency Resilience Forum (ERF) - This is also attended by Essex Street Pastors. The Joint Emergency Services Inter-operationally Programme (JESIP) forum for the ERF is also attended as we are now a recognised body in Essex as Response Pastors. Pubwatch - These groups in Billericay, Basildon and Southend forms part of the Night Time Economy patrols providing a cohesive platform which continues to share best practices.",

This support helps older people develop the confidence to speak up for themselves and voice concerns about issues affecting them. We provide generic advocacy ranging from finances and benefits, through to consumer complaints and disability issues. Many of the people we support have underlying issues such as dementia, ill health, disability and frailty as well as the immediate issues for which they seek our help. OCAY supports people to make decisions and implement solutions for themselves, rather than providing advice. We also signpost service users to other organizations in York, if their needs can be better met by another service. Our advocates support clients to access and use these other services if required. Clients need emotional and practical support. OCAY provides emotional support to manage the stress induced by issues such as making claims, which can aggravate existing health difficulties at the root of their claims. OCAY provides the practical support such as help with form filling and supporting at meetings such as assessments and tribunals. We want to achieve a position where all clients have the advocacy support they need and access to appropriate advice and support. We want to maintain timely responses for clients. In 2018/19, OCAY\u2019s staff of 3 (2.6 fte) and volunteer team of 26 supported 301 clients. So far in this financial year we have supported 325 people.",

We sing, chat and laugh with all of our participants who have come to rely on the service we provide. All of them are over 70 years of age and some are 90+. Many of them have chronic health conditions and most live alone. We have provided transport to our sessions to enable them to come along in the winter months and this was very much appreciated by them. The work we have done to combat loneliness and isolation cannot be measured - although judging by the feedback, comments and letter we have received over the past 4 years we know that a Musical Memories session means so much to all our participants and I am very concerned as to how they will fair without them. In summary - they will be heartbroken and lonely."

This is evidenced by our growing list of referrals with many of our activities over-subscribed. Over the last year 435 children and young people accessed a SELFA activity, including wellbeing projects; holiday workshops and trips; and residentials. The school holidays can be particularly difficult for those who are socially isolated or have difficult home lives and SELFA helps to mitigate this with regular opportunities to meet other people, forge friendships and have fun. We offer lots of opportunities to develop confidence and self-esteem and gain independence through learning skills, trying new things and by taking on responsibilities as part of a task.",

We operate throughout the East Riding of Yorkshire and occasionally surrounding areas including Hull and York. All services are provided at no cost to participants, although employers may be charged for more comprehensive support. We deliver group workshops, in small peer groups of 4 - 6 people over four sessions, each lasting around three hours one day per week. The sessions are confidence building, assertiveness, anxiety management and recognising your skills. The workshops are delivered at various venues across the county. If group workshops seem too much for people, we sometimes offer a limited number of one to one support sessions for people, but this is as a lead in to joining the workshops, not counselling. Mental health is very important and we offer training and information for employers or other organisations on maintaining good mental health, and an overview of mental health problems and personality disorders. Holding on to paid employment is important for people and for employers. With huge costs to recruit, induct and train new staff, it makes far more economic sense to retain valuable employees rather than let them go because of the need for additional support. We offer bespoke training and information for employers. An introductory workshop is arranged followed by more intense workshops and cooperation if requested. This service may carry a nominal charge for companies, but it is very cost effective.",

A lack of confidence is one of the biggest challenges a person who has been diagnosed with sight loss faces. In response we deliver \u2018 Living with Sight Loss\u2019 courses. These are designed around a programme of workshops delivered by professionals to those who are newly diagnosed as blind or with serious sight loss and those who are experiencing a deterioration of an existing eye condition. These courses give knowledge, practical advice and boost confidence which, ultimately, enables people to deal with their sight loss in a more positive way. We offer a network of support, activities and friendship groups which are fully accessible to those who are blind. Through our regular social and activity groups, we enable our members to overcome the isolation and sense of exclusion often experienced as a result of the loss of sight. Our members can take part in fortnightly In-Touch groups which gives them the opportunity to meet up with old friends and to forge new friendships.",

Our volunteers receive ongoing supervision and training. All of our staff and team of volunteers are trained in safeguarding procedures. Once trained, volunteers are carefully assigned a family who they visit each week in their own homes for 2-3 hours. We aim to safeguard, protect and preserve good health, both mental and physical of parents and their children. To prevent cruelty to or maltreatment of children. To relieve sickness, poverty and need among parents and their children. To promote the education of the public in better standards of childcare. After over 30 years of Home-Start York's services in the city, we play an integral part as statutory services continue to withdraw services.

We have identified that many residents in a rural location can feel isolated and vulnerable and we have to strive to provide assistance and support by offering a range of support services. Our work helps our residents and volunteers break isolation and make lasting friendships, access services and the practical help they need or take up one to one support to address barriers that stop them fully engaging in community life. We provide a community hub as a focal point for local services where people can obtain information, advice, support and help. Developing, coordinating and managing local volunteers to operate and develop improved local services by stimulating involvement in local action. Operating and maintain community transport using volunteer drivers, for residents who are not able to access public or private transport. Operating a community library and library delivery service to support the residents in Nidderdale and Washburn and involving the community in its further development to meet local needs.",

Last year we supported over 2,000 people in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire.

We run a homelessness prevention programme which gives people the skills, confidence, knowledge and connections to prevent their own homelessness. We run Housing First projects in collaboration with local housing associations. In all of Aspire's programmes, we ensure that people with lived experience are involved at every stage, including co-designing the projects that we run and in 2019 helped to establish Oxfordshire's first Lived Experience Forum.",

We have a team of volunteers who befriend and mentor the residents separately to encourage and listen and simply be a friend.

We have a vision of a community in which all dying people and those close to them have access to appropriate care and support, when they need it, wherever they need it and whoever they are. Our aim is to bring quality of life to patients and their families, carers and friends so that they can make each day count. Across Somerset we offer a range of services: \u2022 Our Community Teams provide care and support in the familiar environment of a patient\u2019s own homes. The community teams provide care for over 260 patients at any one time. \u2022 Our 24 hour referral and advice line receives an average of 786 calls per month from patients and carers who need advice from a palliative care nurse and health professionals wishing to make a referral. \u2022 Our Sunflower Centre Day Services welcomes attendees who are well enough to live at home but who want to take advantage of our specialist care available through the day. The Sunflower Centre also provides respite for carers. \u2022 Our In-patient Unit in Taunton offers patients with complex care needs comfortable surroundings where they receive extra support, symptom control and pain management from specialist teams. \u2022 Our Outpatients Services provide a wide range of therapies including Lymphodema Treatment, Physiotherapy, Complementary Therapies, Occupational Therapy, and Psychotherapy. \u2022 Our Bereavement Services supports families and carers who have lost a loved one to a life-limiting illness. Our Family Support Worker is specially trained to help children and young people cope with the loss of a parent. \u2022 Our support groups offer an opportunity for people to meet with people going through a similar experience. Our carer support services come alongside those caring for their loved ones who have a life-limiting illness. \u2022 Our Spiritual Care Team work closely alongside clinical teams to ensure we are caring for patients\u2019 spiritual needs alongside their physical and emotional needs. - Adapting to meet future care needs With over 5,500 people dying in Somerset each year and an estimated 4,000+ people who would benefit from hospice care, we know that there is a growing gap between those we can help and those we are currently unable to reach or support adequately. Over the last couple of years, St Margaret\u2019s has therefore been rethinking how we can improve our reach across the county, address a current national shortfall in medical staffing and respond to patient choice by extending our care within the community, enabling patients to receive end-of-life care closer to home \u2013 while all the time ensuring that we remain financially sustainable. The Board of Trustees have recently confirmed that St Margaret\u2019s will increase our work in the community. Providing end of life care closer to home, while ensuring specialist care is available for those who need it across Somerset, are key components of St Margaret\u2019s strategy. This focus enables our teams to support patients and families in the community in a more proactive way, being able to plan care in advance with patients in their own homes about what their future needs might be. We will increasingly work alongside NHS and adult social care community teams to anticipate and prepare for the changing needs that our patients may have. In-patient services will remain a key component of St Margaret\u2019s and we will bring beds together on one site in Taunton, to reduce the ongoing challenge of maintaining sustainable medical staffing with appropriate skills. Our own patients tell us they would prefer to be at home and we want to make sure this can be achieved. However, we understand that this can put an incredible amount of pressure on carers and families. By extending our community provision we can help support other healthcare providers, families and carers to meet the wishes of the patient while feeling safe and supported. St Margaret\u2019s Hospice Care\u2019s strategy is to further increase this in the coming years. Alongside this we are also developing work to encourage early referrals to the hospice. Often people come to the hospice later on in their illness. However, if we can provide opportunities for people with a life-limiting illness to access hospice care earlier we will be able direct them towards activities and support which will assist in improving the quality of their life. This will enable them to remain in control in their home environment, adapting as their health needs change. - Are you sitting comfortably? We would like the Active Living Programme to consider supporting us so that we can offer something new to our patients. The aim of our project is to provide staff and volunteers with the skills to integrate seated exercise into the services currently provided by the Hospice. We believe that this will improve patient's physical and mental wellbeing. By training our staff and volunteers we will have an ongoing and sustainable resource to benefit patients beyond the period of the grant. The seated exercise programmes will be integrated into our existing day hospice provision to enhance the care and subsequent benefits of the service to patients. St Margaret\u2019s Hospice is one charity for the people of Somerset, caring and supporting patients and their families and carers. This new focus will ensure that the charity is in the best possible shape to continue providing high quality, responsive care for more people facing a life-limiting illness across Somerset in the months, and years, to come.",

                    "description": "The aims of Nourish - Bumps, Babies and Breastfeeding are to protect, promote and support breastfeeding within the community of Bridgwater and the surrounding villages. Nourish provides a weekly support group, held in Cannington, offering pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers the opportunity to seek support, information and empathy in a non-clinical environment for a small donation. Up until January 2018 the group had been funded by NCT (National Childbirth Trust) and was called NCT Cannington Bumps, Babes and Breastfeeding group. Unfortunately due to funding constraints facing the charity, the NCT could not continue to financially support the group. Thus the breast feeding counsellor leading the service and a handful of passionate and dedicated breastfeeding peer supporters decided to establish the group Nourish to enable the continuation of pregnancy, baby and breastfeeding support service. Support and information about breastfeeding is provided within Nourish by a qualified Breastfeeding Counsellor and trained Breastfeeding Peer Supporters. Women are often referred to the group by midwives and health visitors requiring specific support for breastfeeding, whilst others find the group from publicity such as Facebook, flyers or word of mouth. The group aims to provide a warm, friendly, open environment where women feel safe and secure to express their emotions and seek support to enable them to have a positive breastfeeding experience. As Nourish is free from the constraints of a clinical setting and the pressures on health professionals, we are able to give mothers unlimited time, to listen and offer mother-led support. This enables families to make informed decisions and have a positive experience with breastfeeding. Although Nourish offers support and information about breastfeeding a mother does not need to have an issue directly relating to breastfeeding to attend. All too often a mother needs the emotional support of other mothers to ward off feelings of isolation, anxiety or to simply discuss their trials and tribulations of parenthood whilst establishing friendships. In this way the group positively supports not only breastfeeding but the varied and sometimes challenging experiences of parenting. The group welcomes older siblings attending with their mother so that mothers with subsequent children are included within our reach. Toys and activities are provided to entertain older sibling so that their mother can spend time talking to other mums or seeking support from the peer supporters or breastfeeding counsellor. Refreshments such as tea, coffee and cake help a mother feel relaxed and welcome as well as providing much needed calories to meet the demands of nourishing her baby. We positively welcome the attendance of partners/husband alongside their breastfeeding partner/wife as women who have support to breastfeed from family members feel empowered to continue their breastfeeding journey when faced with challenges. Overall the group's aim is to nourish women, both physically and emotionally, to enable them to have a positive breastfeeding experience."

                    "description": "The Willow Set Preschool and Sun Up, Sun Down Club is located in Stoke St Gregory approximately 12 miles fromTaunton, Bridgwater, Langport and Street. It is a rural village that includes families from a wide range of backgrounds including the farming industry, Clarks, Hinkley Point and of course willow growing businesses. The setting opened approximately 35 years ago in the church rooms and is now, after hard work and fundraising, situated on the primary school site. We are a committee run preschool with charity status also offering wrap around care. I have managed and run the preschool and wrap around care setting for over 22 years. The wrap around club has only been open just over 5 years and is growing as the need from working parents increases. My aim is to continue to provide outstanding facilities to nurture the children aged 2-11 yrs and provide a rich safe environment with outstanding inside and outside facilities. We also now run a holiday club which has highlighted an obvious need in the community as many of the days over the last six weeks have been at capacity, we again offer outstanding experiences for children to grow and have fun. The project will enable us to offer more for all the children who attend all our 3 settings. I also organise an annual free play evening every for every child, especially as we have families with some diverse needs. Each child will comes with an adult , this has numerous positives as I want parents/carers involved in all we are doing. Firstly to supervise, thus ensuring safety, but really to engage themselves and have fun with all the children. The ethos of the event is to involve parents and promote social cohesion across preschool, wrap around care and outlying organizations and supporting the understanding that Play refers to a collection of voluntary, intrinsically motivated activities that are usually associated with PLEASURE and enjoyment.Or FUN. This is an outside event providing healthy foods to explore and eat will support those families in need of this help. We have a number of disadvantaged children in the village and outlying areas, therefore this being a free evening makes it available to all regardless of their backgrounds. As a setting we work with other organisations in and around the village as we feel every child is important and deserves the best experiences throughout their childhood.",

                    "description": "Seed of Hope CIC is a Social Enterprise offering Recovery based Social and Therapeutic Horticulture for people with mental health problems. We are based in The Walled Gardens of Cannington and supported in kind by Bridgwater and Taunton College who provide horticultural expertise and facilities. We currently run one day a week on Tuesdays. Our main sessions provide a six hour day of mixed horticultural activity, a yoga lesson and a Recovery group. The therapeutic horticultural activity is tailored to the varied levels of physical ability in the group. We pace the activity throughout the day and take regular breaks. We use the elements intrinsic to horticulture - Being outdoors in nature, increased light levels, working as part of a team towards a common goal, nurturing living plants and environments, gentle exercise and Hope - to deliver improved mental and physical well-being for our participants. Our yoga sessions are offered as a tool for participants to use in day to day life to aid relaxation and improve physical ability. It also serves as a physical warm up prior to our horticultural activity. The Recovery group is based on the format devised by Dr Abraham Lowe in the 1920s and used for many years by Recovery international. Participants share their experiences, support each other and explore the concepts of Recovery. Participants also have the opportunity to gain a level 1 qualification in Practical Horticultural Skills awarded by City and Guilds and assessed by the college. Seed of Hope CIC has three sources of income1-Trading income - Our main product is our horticultural sessions which are paid for through personal health or social care budgets. We also sell a variety of products both online and through the Walled Gardens of Cannington shop. These include household items and garden planters made from upcycled pallet wood, wildflower seeds (Seeds of Hope) and plants that have been grown by participants. We are also plan on expanding our groups to people with dementia and people experiencing work related stress. 2- Projects - Our projects have three aims- to provide a goal for our participants, to improve community green spaces, and to provide income. Our award winning Spring Orchard project was completed in 2017 and we are currently working on the Cannington Church Gardens of Rest. Our design for this project was a finalist in the Church Times Green Church Awards 2017. 3- Grant income- As a Social enterprise we aim to be less reliant on this source of income than the other two. However at this start-up phase of our development we need grant funding to support us whilst we grow and develop. Seed of Hope CIC is set up as a Social Enterprise as opposed to a charity for two main reasons. We believe that the current dominant systems of service provision in mental health take power away from service users. Power is an important factor in a person's Recovery. Setting up as a charity implies that people with mental health problems require charity to help them rather than having the power to work co-operatively in their Recovery. Secondly being in control of the source of our income and how it is spent allows us to maintain our independence as an organisation. This is important to us because it means we do not have to work in ways which we know don't help people with mental health problems in their Recovery journey. Being a CIC allows us to work as a co operative. Everyone who takes part in Seed of Hope CIC can become a member of the CIC entitling them a vote on company policy and strategy. Our founding principles are enshrined in our articles of association, these are- 8.1 Recovery - Seed of Hope CIC is a Recovery based organisation. 8.2 Mental Health - Seed of Hope CIC is concerned with the mental health of participants. We are not convinced by the scientific evidence and through our own experience, of the existence of Mental Illness. This does not discount an individual\u2019s experience of psychological or emotional distress, or the negative impact of this on a person\u2019s life. 8.3 Pay Equality\u2013 Seed of Hope CIC will value the contribution of all employees regardless of seniority in the organisation. Seed of Hope CIC will be a co-operative organisation, and as such will cap the maximum pay of any employee to two and a half times that of the lowest paid employee. 8.4 Membership- Every participant will be offered the opportunity to contribute to the governance of the organisation as a Member as defined in these articles. 8.5 Intrinsic Elements-The main activity of Seed of Hope CIC is Social and Therapeutic Horticulture. The main elements of which are shown through research to provide positive outcomes for the participants. Seed of Hope CIC will also carry out activities that provide some or all of the intrinsic elements for participants. 8.6 Diversity of Income-To maintain the independence of Seed of Hope CIC which may be compromised by a disproportionate reliance on any one stream of income. Income will be sought from all of the following sources-Grants, Trading Income, Payment by Participants, Fundraising Activity, Commissioned Activity. 8.7 Participant Director- It is of paramount importance to Seed of Hope CIC to have a Participant Director on the Management Team. In order for them to carry out their role all reasonable adjustments will be made to the organisations arrangements for meetings of the Management Team. 8.8 Humour- Mental Health problems can be both life limiting and life threatening. There is much sadness and distress involved in the lives of those experiencing mental distress. Seed of Hope CIC will at all times work in a positive hopeful way and this includes the use of humour at all levels of our interactions. The intention of this is to raise spirits, reflect on the irony of situations, maintain and promote hope and mental well being. It is not intended to harass, belittle, distress, discriminate, bully or intimidate.",

Provide equality for residents of Glastonbury and its surrounding areas who want support for mental ill health or emotional issues by offering affordable and easy access to therapeutic services. We believe in offering choice for individuals who are on a journey of self-help and exploration, meaning people can work with therapeutic methods that suits them best. Our services currently include low cost counselling, eco-therapy, group and art therapy support. 2. Nurture students by providing practical learning experiences for the next generation of counsellors and therapists who are training for their qualifications. We set the trust up because we saw an increase in people suffering who were not able to get access to professional support for their mental health. This was due to obstacles including long waiting lists, cancellations, long distant treatment, high costs associated to private therapy. The increasing demand for professional therapeutic support has put a significant strain on local services. Our aim is to help alleviate some of the burden experienced by local GP\u2019s, schools, local charities, since they are struggling to support the need for help from people relating to mental health struggles.",

In Shepton Mallet we provide many varied services from children's activities to work with the homeless. Our weekly programme consists of two parent and toddler groups, a community drop in with a job club. A digital link club offering both internet access to look and apply for employment, help to provide support with basic computing knowledge, and helping people understand IT when apply for benefits and pay bill's. We also run a Community lunch club which is attended by people who are either looking to get out of the house for a bit of company, people dependant on alcohol and other substances or in some cases for people who don't have enough money to buy food. We also run a club for older people in our community that meets once a week providing them with a place to come and chat with each and share in the activities that we put on. A Brass band for children from the age of 9 upwards. Once a month on a Saturday we run a family craft activity with a cooked meal, to encourage the whole family to spend time together. We have a Charity Shop attached to our building which offers us are only real source of income, and also allows us to be open throughout the week to meet the needs of our community. One of the biggest parts of our work in the community though is the running of the local food bank. over the last twelve months we have given away over 400 food parcels providing food for families or individuals when they cant afford it. The food bank is run on a referral basis and we work closely with agencies, both professional and voluntary, so that we are not just simply handing out food but helping to deal with the underlying need of why the service users do not have enough money to buy it. Along side the food bank we run a Christmas appeal. Again this takes referrals from agenesis of families who without help for what ever reason could not have afforded Christmas. We do around seventy Christmas food hampers and provide toys for over one hundred and fifty children.",

In 2012, our founder moved to the UK, unable to speak or understand English. She will not forget how hard everything was. She had started a new life, in a new country, expecting her first child. She looked for an organization, to reduce the loneliness she felt. Online she found nothing local. She joined ESOL and in 2014 started her own friendship group for migrant mothers. We remain the only group of its kind locally, and have all-female trustees with experience of migration. We hold friendship groups with women and their children, English classes and other workshops. Our activities are driven by peer-to-peer support built between members. We enable migrant women to overcome barriers in achieving their self-defined aspirations. Our work supports families, to feel safe, and secure, whilst also enabling them to feel pride in Southend as their home by encouraging them to be actively involved in their communities.",

Our mission is to work with people who are disadvantaged, in a non-judgemental way in order to improve their lives. We have been operating in Braintree since 1981 and over that time we have worked with other agencies and hundreds of clients. We see a wide range of clients including: Those who have a history of mental health Those who have learning disabilities Substance mis-users The homeless Single Parents Unemployed Ex-offenders Senior citizens We offer many interventions in order to make a difference, these are: Basic Skills education classes (English, Maths and Computer Classes) Life Skills training (anger management, self-esteem building, budgeting skills) Individual Time Limited Counselling Benefits advice Job seeking skills (C.V. construction and interview techniques) Advocacy Service (within the context of citizen advocacy) Canteen Befriending Many of the clients that access First Stop are people that have slipped through the net. Some are unable to read and write, many are not engaging with other statutory agencies. Because we are a small independent charity, we are able to work with these clients and in many cases provide the support in order that they can access the help they need. We provide the clients with a positive experience, which gives them the best chance of making changes in and to their lives and moving forward. Each week we see over 50 clients. The difference we made to these clients included: Many were able to engage in classes and work towards a formal qualification. Some clients were able to produce a C.V. and to link this to internet job sites, where appropriate Clients who attended our anger management classes have reported they have been able to start making more positive choices about their behaviour We helped clients towards social inclusion and become less socially isolated Provided a safe meeting place for other interventions from other agencies- as we are known to many of their clients and they feel safe meeting here We pride ourselves on being non-judgmental and working to enable the client, for some this is over a short period of time, for others this may take a lot longer, and the forming of a trusting relationship with us is a huge step for some. We are able to take steps at the client\u2019s pace, and we often feel like parents gently pushing the clients to make positive choices and steps towards becoming a more active, healthy member of our community.",

                    "description": "Community360 (C360) is an independent charity formed in 1968. We are committed to a vision to build \u201cthriving local communities\u201d. Our Mission is: - \u201cTo inspire and enable local community action to improve quality of life\u201d. We aim to do this in line with our core values, which are to: - provide passionate, intelligent leadership for the sector in Colchester, Essex and beyond; - empower people, groups and organisations through high quality support - -be creative and innovative in meeting the needs of local communities and the voluntary and community groups and organisations that serve them; and - be fair and honest in everything we do We achieve this through a number of projects, including an experienced Community Development team, Community Accounts Service and Business Bank. As a result, staff lead on community volunteering programmes with more than 400 volunteers, work with over 300 community groups a year to access funding, embed good financial practices, recruit their own volunteers, plan and train, as well as network and promote what they do. We value working in partnership and consult regularly with the sector to guide the development of policy, co-produce new projects and deliver services. We also manage programmes that provide fundamental, practical support to the community. Our Community Transport schemes facilitate over 50,000 trips each year and we hire scooters and wheelchairs to people 5 days a week. Our organisation is constantly evolving, anticipating opportunities in our community and seeking to maximise the impact that we can all have to make our vision a reality. As the provider of Community Voluntary Services (CVS) for Braintree District, we deliver projects that improve the quality of life for local residents and enable voluntary action to impact in neighborhoods and parishes. At the heart of what we do is Community Development. We support charities and non-profit making groups to form, establish their activities and continue to operate, whilst upholding good standards of practice. We help them to find the resources they need (i.e. funds or in kind donations), network and collaborate to enhance their opportunities (such as through Lunch and Learn sessions) and to learn and develop with the provision of courses and bespoke training. We are involved in many fora and committees to work well across the voluntary and community sector. We identify gaps and develop services to meet them. For example, we have established the Braintree District Older Persons forum, where agencies that support older people can network and work together on shared agendas to support older residents in the district. We manage Braintree Time Bank \u2013 we encourage social action through the principles co-production, time bank members use time as currency to exchange skills and support. Over the past year 57 new time bank members have exchanged 2000 hours of time to support the local community through initiatives such as a Community Caretakers scheme and i-tea computing sessions. We oversee Braintree Volunteer Centre \u2013 as 1 of 14 centres in the Volunteer Essex network we advertise and recruit volunteers for 200 organisations as well as provide guidance and support around volunteer management and best practice. We have placed 69 volunteers in the first six months of the year. We are introducing a Slipper Exchange as part of our falls prevention agenda. Braintree residents can exchange old, sloppy and worn slipper for a new well fitted pair as well as find out information on support services and community activities. We have already exchanged 45 pairs with plans to expand this during the Winter period. We also have a strong commitment to health and wellbeing initiatives, which we would like to continue to expand. We embed good health and wellbeing throughout all of our programmes. However, we seek to offer targeted support where possible. This may be through volunteering, our community weight management service, providing social groups or monthly Tree-Mendous walks of Braintree and Bocking Gardens. Throughout Mid Essex we work with a range of partners and have particular strong working synergies with Braintree District Council as part of the Live Well Child campaign (addressing childhood obesity and working with ten schools in the district), Active Braintree Network and the Strategic Health and Wellbeing Board. We pride ourselves on providing proactive community engagement, meaning we like to take our services to people. Working throughout the district we understand the challenges faced by town and rural communities, particularly with regards to accessing services. We are adept at working with residents to establish activities based on their needs, rather than prescribing a \u2018one size fits all approach\u2019.",

Iranians make up the highest proportion of asylum applications to the U.K. and Hull has a disproportionate number of Iranians who have settled in the city. ICOH has around 300 active members. We work in close liaison with leading local charities and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) community groups based in Hull and Yorkshire to: - Deliver training and employment services. - Support asylum seekers with their relocation. - Provide emotional support and special services. - Run cultural and social activities. Training and social activities are used by ICOH to introduce beneficiaries to British and other minority ethnic customs, reduce loneliness and discourage segregation. We have already seen more members finding employment, gaining confidence speaking English to local people, befriending individuals from outside their ethnic community and an understanding of British customs.",

We provided temporary connectivity via dongles in many cases and delivered instruction in use of all the equipment.

In particular, the company focuses on providing courses for young people who find it difficult to cope with the formal education system, are from deprived backgrounds and who face multiple barriers to personal development. The objective of the programmes offered is to create opportunities for young people to develop their social skills, gain confidence and self-esteem and break out of an often isolated and marginalised existence. The company offers a BTEC course in Active Sports and Leisure and has contracts with local schools and academies to deliver the programme. In addition, the company offers evening activities that are not qualification based but are focused on developing on young people's team skills, learning how to relate to others and understanding their role in the local community. The recently delivered I Will Fund financed project in conjunction with the Two Ridings Foundation was a great success and we have continued to provide for the young people using our resources and a small grant from the Crime Reduction Fund. A small group of 8 volunteers has been formed from the group arising from the young people\u2019s own initiative.We focus on the most vulnerable young people in the local community.",

Participants can also take part in events, helping sell the crafts, giving them the opportunity to meet the public and demonstrate their skills, talents and abilities. This also raises their self-esteem, reduces their social isolation and benefits their mental wellbeing. Our trained mosaic artists have an incredible opportunity to be part of our \"mosaics for schools\" project where they teach children in primary schools how to mosaic over the course of 6 visits to the school. The objective of this project is that we break down barriers between the able and less-able in our society, children have the experience of working with those who are differently-able and discover that these differences are not so great after all. For our artisans, it is a rare and empowering opportunity to be the one teaching a skill as opposed to receiving instruction. We also run two after-school craft clubs for children with disabilities and special needs, providing vital opportunities for social interaction, having fun and learning new skills in a caring and supporting environment.",

Also a communal meal on a Wednesday that was focused on our vulnerable and lonely community members, this was being done on a donation basis so that those who couldn't afford were still made welcome.

Our Board of Trustees, many of whom are Carers themselves, oversee our charity\u2019s aims which are: 1) To have a positive impact on outcomes for Carers 2) To raise public awareness about Carers 3) To improve public awareness of the organisation 4) To ensure the sustainability of the organisation for the benefit of Carers We hold NCVO\u2019s PQASSO Quality Mark at Level 3; only the fourth organisation in the UK and the first in Essex to achieve this. The assessors noted in particular the dedication of the staff and volunteers and stated that \u201cGovernance is truly excellent \u2013 it is a real strength of the organisation in all its aspects\u201d. The needs and views of Carers in Essex are central to all we do. We consult with Carers regularly to ensure we provide the support they need, when needed. We facilitate regular Carer Reference groups and Carer Forums. Carers save the economy millions of pounds each year through unpaid care. We support them to continue to care appropriately. There are an estimated 180,000 adult Carers in Essex. We support adult Carers with advice and guidance and through our \u2018Feeling Good, Caring Well\u2019 wellbeing programme; volunteer-led counselling and befriending; training and support to return to work. We give Carers respite with the provision of day services for older people and activity groups for people with dementia or memory problems. We support Young Carers under 18 with Young Carer clubs and a programme of support in schools. Young Carers may help care for a family member with a long-term illness, physical or sensory impairment, mental health problems or a drug/alcohol addiction. BBC research estimates that 1/5 secondary pupils is a Young Carer. Clubs give Young Carers an opportunity to enjoy being a child in a safe environment with other Young Carers who understand the issues they face. In schools, we help to address the inequality faced by Young Carers where they achieve nine GCSE grades lower than their non-caring peers. We will advocate for a Young Carer with their teacher, perhaps explaining why they have trouble completing homework or getting to school on time, and help them to work out strategies so they can achieve the best possible outcomes. We give transition support to Young Adult Carers as they balance caring with making important life choices including education and employment. We are a Network Partner of Carers Trust and promote our services through their network. We also have agreed ways of working with other voluntary sector organisation such as Age UK and Community Agents. We work with children\u2019s services within the county council and receive referrals from them. We promote our activities and services via our webpage, Facebook, Twitter, local media, presence at community events, CVS offices and via schools and youth groups.",

Early prevention through the transition to parenthood is at the heart of our work. Evidence is clear - it is a time when people are particularly open to change. Drawing on strengths in communities we nurture the resilience of vulnerable parents during this critical time to achieve the following outcomes: \u2022 The best start in life for babies \u2022 Resilient parents and communities that are less dependent on limited professional resources Our aim is to establish purposeful, supportive peer relationships during pregnancy that enable volunteers and parents to feel valued, respected, supported and socially connected. By nurturing parents\u2019 resilience (and in turn their babies), we contribute to positive outcomes during the \"1001 Critical Days\" (UK Cross Party Manifesto). We aim to prevent escalation of need. Our \u2018Pregnancy Pal and Birth Buddy\u2019 volunteer programme began in South Essex in 2010 to address a clear gap in support for vulnerable, disadvantaged families. Over the past nine years we have developed a high-quality volunteering initiative that reduces social isolation, helps expectant and new parents prepare for changes ahead, increases resilience, and improves relationships between parents and their infants. We achieve this by building trusting peer relationships, starting in pregnancy, continuing in hospital during labour and birth and ongoing during the early months of parenting. We prioritise communities in Basildon, Thurrock and Canvey Island facing significant social, health and educational inequalities particularly families living in the 10%/20% most deprived postcodes. As well as improving the health, wellbeing and resilience of vulnerable parents, we also aim to make the experience of our volunteer peer supporters deeply rewarding. Our volunteers often describe their involvement as \u2018life changing\u2019. Through skilled, regular supervision and extensive training, our volunteers state improved: personal development (86%); knowledge of health issues (71%); self-confidence (71%); and awareness of local services (86%). Volunteers can improve their employability prospects by gaining a level 3 national vocational qualification through our City and Guilds Accreditation Centre. Evidence of learning and skills into practice are derived from the natural volunteer setting. Peer support is provided by volunteers and paid workers. They are trained to focus on parents\u2019 strengths and assets, treat them as equal partners, and avoid dependency by empowering vulnerable parents, communities and families to do more for themselves and their children. A Pregnancy Pal or Birth Buddy is \u201csomeone in their corner\u201d providing flexible, personalised support throughout pregnancy, labour and birth and the early months of being a parent. Drawing on lived experience or shared characteristics our peer supporters aim to provide knowledge, emotional support, practical help and social interaction. Their strengths-based, non-judgemental approach enables them to build trusting relationships with vulnerable women who may be wary of professionals. We provide the following activities: 1. Intensive one-to-one peer support (home, hospital, community) to vulnerable women and their partners (early pregnancy to 6 months post birth, over 120 families a year, up to 2-hours a week) provided by thoroughly trained and supervised volunteers and paid staff. Parents are encouraged to set and review self-selected achievable goals. For very vulnerable women our birth buddies provide emotional and practical support throughout labour and birth. 2. Weekly community outreach activities to meet pregnant women face-to-face (2-3 hours per session, 10 disadvantaged locations). These take place in GP and children\u2019s centre antenatal clinics, Essex Youth Services, homeless hostels, Thorney Bay Caravan Park in Canvey Island, and women\u2019s refuges. We provide supported signposting and opportunities for pregnant or post birth women to request one-to-one peer support. We set-up information stands at Basildon maternity unit (weekly). Each year, we engage with over 1200 expectant parents via these activities. 3. Antenatal and postnatal exercise and wellbeing sessions (100 women each year). A qualified perinatal fitness trainer and health promotion specialist runs weekly 2-hour sessions in 3 disadvantaged locations (Laindon, Vange, Canvey). Each session is followed by an informal talk about pregnancy and parenthood. Attendees make connections and continue exercising together at the end of the programme. We support them to set up their own buggy walks. 4. Workshops for expectant fathers (2-hours, twice a month in Grays and Basildon): delivered by experienced and qualified antenatal teachers. Topics include: how to support their partner during labour; preparing for changes ahead (e.g. family relationships, mental health); and practical baby-care. 5. Informal groups for pregnant women to meet each other: delivered in Family Hubs (7 disadvantaged locations where there is no provision, 2-hours, monthly basis). These are informal information sessions with simple quizzes about labour and birth; keeping well; and becoming a parent. We encourage new friendships that continue beyond the sessions. 6. Video Interaction Guidance during home visits to parents at risk of poor bonding with their babies (20 parents a year). By sharing positive video clips for parents to reflect on, we nurture attuned early parent-infant relationships. 7. Recruiting, training and supervising volunteers (maintaining an ongoing pool of 30 volunteers): we deliver free four-week taster courses each year (total of 12 hours) that enable local parents to gain new skills, build confidence and find out whether being a Pregnancy Pal or Birth Buddy is right for them. Those recruited to become volunteers attend high quality training (76 hours) and induction that prepares them to carry out the role and receive ongoing one-to-one supervision and peer group meetings (monthly basis). We work particularly closely with community midwives who regularly refer vulnerable pregnant women. A programme manager, a volunteer coordinator and a trainer operate the programme carrying out volunteer recruitment, collaboration with professionals, introductory visits to pregnant women in their homes, matching volunteers to pregnant women\u2019s\u2019 needs, safeguarding, regular volunteer supervision, risk assessments, and ongoing evaluation.",

It will draw on existing local assets and resources and develop the current provision by expanding the networks to form partnerships and collaborations across the community and the local area. New projects are already emerging that Project Factory is being asked to support by either leading the delivery or supporting the partnerships necessary to ensure success. Project Factory\u2019s long-term aims include the creation of a hub where it can facilitate both individual and collaborative enterprise, drive opportunities for personal development and skill sharing and embrace a diverse community to promote well-being, bridge differences and develop a mindset that helps build a strong, connected community. The work is multi-faceted and ambitious - on the one hand, Project Factory listens; it starts conversations; it builds partnerships; it grows networks; it encourages collaboration; it communicates - on the other, it delivers informal education opportunities to grow confidence and develop skills; it holds forums and conferences to build consensus; it holds community events to inspire and create joy. It responds to the emerging ideas and \u2018seeds\u2019 and works to help organisations and individuals develop their own projects. Project Factory believes in the value of listening and curiosity, the power of experiential learning, the importance of story and playfulness, the potential that lies in unique skills and gifts inherent in each member of the community- which is evoked through connection, collaboration, communication and celebration.",
