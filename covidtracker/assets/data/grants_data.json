In addition to the above client facing services we also run a Mental Health Referral Triage service on behalf of West Essex CCG. This service processes all GP mental health referrals across West Essex and passes them on to the relevant provider. We have an active presence on social media platforms as part of our efforts to normalise mental health and engage with the public in a way that is accessible to a wide range of people. We are also actively engaged with the Time to Change Movement, particularly through engagement with local employers. We aspire to ensure that the following values can be clearly visible throughout our organisation: Welcoming: to everyone who comes into contact with any part of our organisation. Open: to all forms of feedback and open to change. Inclusive: everyone who is part of our organisation feels included and involved. Informed: We listen to what people are telling us and keep up to date with information about best practice. Responsive: We strive to be responsive to the changing needs of the population of West Essex and to the changing requirements of those who commission services from us. Effective: everyone who receives a service from us is helped to move forward on their journey towards mental wellbeing. Giving people the skills and techniques to deal with these issues again in the future.",

Our aim is to help prevent homelessness with early intervention as well as helping people overcome homelessness for good. Everything we do is geared towards helping people move away from homelessness permanently, enabling them to lead happy, independent and fulfilling lives within the community. We support over 1,200 people on average every year and as the amount of people affected by homelessness grows so does the demand for our services. At HARP, we are always looking at new ways to help people get off the streets - and stay off the streets. The number of bed spaces we are able to offer has grown, as part of HARP\u2019s response to the growing need in the town, from 174 in mid-2018 to 214 today, plus additional sleeping spaces in our Extended Emergency Service - an overnight shelter at our Bradbury Centre for those in immediate need. we have always emphasised that rough sleeping is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of overall levels of homelessness. Although this is the most visible and dangerous aspect, there are countless more people in precarious accommodation, sofa-surfing, or staying in temporary housing who need ongoing support to avoid and overcome homelessness. And new people are finding themselves in these precarious and often dangerous circumstances every day.Nearly half of the people who came to HARP for help in 2019 were using our services for the first time, and over half of those new visitors were sofa surfing, had no fixed abode, or were at risk of losing their accommodation and were in need of help and support to keep it. This only goes to show how many local people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and are in danger of ending up on the streets. We desperately need more social housing and affordable accommodation (and this means properties to rent, not just \u201caffordable housing\u201d for people fortunate enough to be able to purchase), as well as better support for people struggling with their financial and housing situations, and a genuine effort to tackle the root causes of homelessness.",

We have a membership of 130 charites and community groups that work in the Maldon District and offer services such as funding advice, governance advice, information provision and representation. In addition we also host the districts Volunteer Centre and other projects that support people with Maldon District to be more involved with their community. At the current time these projects include - The Essex Shed Network: after successfully launching the Maldon Shed in 2014 Maldon and District CVS were approached by other districts to support them to set up similar projects. Men in Shed projects provide community spaces with a focus on practical activities such as woodwork. These spaces enable local men to build friendships and gain/offer peer support which has the ultimate outcome of improving social connections and decreasing feelings of loneliness. The Essex Shed Network provides support, information and networking opportunities to people involved with or wishing to be involved with Men in Shed projects - Blokes: - spinning off from the Essex Shed Network we are working in partnership with Active Maldon to facilitate local men having support to access existing local services and activities that have positive health outcomes such as walking football or weight management schemes. - Southminster Patio Project: - working with the Memorial Hall in Southminster we are setting up a community gardening space at the rear of their project to enhance the Memorial Halls offer as a community hub for Southminster and to have wellbeing outcomes for local people - Harbour: - running for ten years this project provides social support to local people who are a risk of social isolation. As a weekly coffee morning it offers access to Connect Well social prescribing and wellbeing activities such as gardening, singing and crafts as well as the opportunity to make friendships. - Wellbeing walks: Weekly walks at Maldon Prom Park to encourage people to walk socially as a first step to healthier lives. - The Maldon Active Support Team: this project add value to all the above and the wider sector through the Volunteer Centre and other contacts. Working in a person centred way the project provides bespoke one to one support to people who have barriers to community involvement such as mental health conditions, physical disabilities, low income or low confidence. The Coordinator works with them to explore options they may be interested in and facilitate their involvement, this includes help with form filling, accompanied visits, adaption of opportunities and ongoing support. The MAST project also hosts some small group activities as tasters for community involvement, these are being merged with some of the above projects as the MAST project comes to an end in December 2018 and we are working as an organisation to preserving the legacy of the project.",

In addition to our minibus services we offer a bespoke car service run by volunteer car drivers in their own cars. This service is tailored to the individual and volunteers are able to assist passengers with shopping or sit with them at medical appointments or support groups. We are also able to offer transport for people to visit their loved ones in hospital or in care homes. Our services are much sought after and we are always running at full capacity.

The Swinemoor Estate is in the top 15% of multiple deprivation in the country. At the heart of the work of the centre is its advice service, which has provided thousands of individuals from Beverley and the East Riding of Yorkshire with a safe, confidential environment where they can receive guidance and support on a wide range of issues including debt, housing, benefits, homelessness, domestic violence, and legal issues. The Centre also aims to address the poverty and social isolation in the community. Many of the local families are reliant on the Centre for food vouchers for the East Yorkshire Foodbank due to low income. The Centre offers a Youth Group, a Women\u2019s Group, a pensioners\u2019 group. a support group for Stroke survivors and their carers, various other community groups, and is an agent for the regional Credit Union.

This enables our users to become more independent and socially active, thus, creating a healthier lifestyle for those using the Goole GoFar service. Goole GoFar initially provided services for the elderly, and apart from school contracts, we very rarely offered young people and children any form of transport. However, we now offer a range of services for our elderly members, as well, as low income families, young people and children. We now work with children centres, youth clubs and community clubs on a continuous basis, as well, as providing transport for children who access extra \u2013 curricular activities through their schools. We also offer a large range of services including: \u2022MiBus and Dial - A - Ride services - access to town shopping services. \u2022The MediBus service - access to hospital, doctors and any medical appointment. \u2022GoFar Outings - Days out to areas within the Yorkshire area. \u2022Lunch outings to eating establishments/ restaurants based locally for the elderly. \u2022Providing the elderly with access to theatre productions \u2022Day Trips for low income families, young people and children who access their local children centre.

It remains an independent charity, predominately working in rural Thirsk and surrounding rural areas. We \u201csupport people in North Yorkshire to engage with and contribute to their community\u201d. The merger has achieved the ambition to have a single point of contact for children, young people, adults and older people who need to access support or a service. We can now provide a truly holistic service, not only to the individual but to the family. We are also providing support to other local charities. Our aim is to facilitate partnerships to support people in North Yorkshire, particularly from Thirsk to connect with and contribute to their community by providing opportunities for them to improve their economic, health and social wellbeing. We have four objectives: Increase Social Inclusion\u2013 We want our communities to be more socially included. Over the next three years our work will help more of our members to belong, join in, and contribute to community life. Fewer people will feel isolated and will have taken up opportunities to make and sustain friendships. More members will have moved on to join other local community groups with our support and taken part in \u2018giving back\u2019 activities that have grown their feelings of community belonging. As part of this we will have delivered focused pieces of work supporting people with mental health problems, older people, unemployed young people, and people with long-term ill health.",

Our costs of providing accommodation are covered by our working arrangement with the City of York Council, but it is by offering an extra level of support that we are able to engage with residents, help them get to the root cause of their homelessness and help them to move forward in their lives, with the ultimate aim of them moving into unsupported accommodation and commit to regular employment. This extra support has to be funded by grants, fundraising events and regular donations. The number of referrals we receive from other agencies ( such as The Probation Service, City of York Council, the Salvation Army and various homeless hostels etc ) has continued to rise. Our residents have a variety of issues, often a combination of mental health issues, physical health issues and addictions and many have previously found themselves in prison. All are unemployed and homeless when they are first referred to us.",

We employ qualified and dedicated Social Workers & Counsellors to deliver a caring professional service, which is structured and intensive where necessary. Our unique approach is to intervene a soon as problems are identified and work with the children for a long as it takes to put things right. Mental health problems affect about 1 in 10 children or young people and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives. Without effective intervention, these conditions can have a significant impact on their life chances. Our experienced mental health professionals not only support the child through one to one counselling sessions but also, by conducting thorough assessments are able to provide expert advice and support to both school staff, parents and families. The majority of children we help come to us, or are referred to us through their school and it is a fact that a child with emotional and behavioural problems can often cause disruption in a classroom and generally hinder their own learning and that of the other children in the class. Through our intervention we are able to offer support to the child or young person, their families as well as both the school and their staff.",

Types of groups range from small entirely voluntary up to large multi million pond charites such as Farleigh. We support small group development in many different ways including constitutions, policies, becoming fit for grant funding, improving branding and marketing, finding funding.

Full assistance with disability issues and completion of Personal Independence Payment (PIP), children's Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance (AA) forms, mandatory reconsiderations and appeals. Whilst not a foodbank we provide and have done for over 13 years , sets of parcels of food and toiletries, loo rolls, baby essentials including nappies, household goods and cleaning liquids to those in an emergency need situation - issued on production of a written referral only from an agency. Staff have the authority to provide goods if necessary. These goods are all donated by churches and other faith organisations, schools and the general public and local businesses. Via a CVS Winter Warmth Grant we provide top ups for gas and electricity meters, in emergency only. We also help with the purchase of uniform for children in an impoverished family situation; these funds are donated to us specifically. We give out tents, airbeds, sleeping bags and chairs to those sleeping rough on the streets and in vehicles; donated via V Festival Clearance and Lighthouse Furniture Project. Also duvets, bedding and towels are provided to those in need once a tenancy has been arranged and where they have no funds to buy such items having paid out deposits and rent in advance to secure a home. We give out what comes in by way of donations as many individuals and agencies both statutory, nonstatutory, voluntary sector, local businesses such as Co-op, Johnsons, Howdens Joinery, Pipetech, individuals, churches and faith organisations give to the Centre. We operate a subsidised canteen serving hot and cold drinks and cold snacks at incredibly cheap prices. Specific Universal Credit assistance is provided, especially with online application and set up and then ongoing via a claimant's journal. Often clients are not able or have the wherewithal or access to a computer for this type of benefit take up and regularly we see people in obvious distress concerning this situation. We are experienced in helping and supporting claimants in enabling access to in order fulfil the requirements of the benefit itself. This is an essential and valuable service and extremely time consuming as more and more folk are being transferred over to UC and then are panicking about application and budgeting the new type of payment. This help was requested by local claimants and by the Job Centre Plus office as they are unable to assist directly with a claim or a setup of a UC account.",

Our main role is to operate the Foodbank from our warehouse in Cheddar. We will also signpost clients to organisations that can help them if necessary. We are committed to raising awareness of our operation in the local area bearing in mind that this is widespread and communication is not the best regarding public transport etc. We collect food from local organisation such as shops, churches, community groups and cafes and local people. We weigh collections and update the Trussel trust data management system with the weights and info regarding the clients we supply food to for their national statistics. We manage the accounts of any monetary donations and pay the overheads of running the warehouse. The acoounts are independently audited every year. We rely totally on volunteers who keep the Foodbank open twice a week for 2 hours at a time and adhere to all health and safety requirements and any Trussel Trust recommendations. We are endeavouring to increase our profile through marketing , word of mouth and some press releases but still have a long way to go on this.",

Support can include giving parents a chance to relax or go out for a few hours; spending time with the sick child or their siblings (talking through their worries and/or facilitating activities); helping both the sick child and their sibling(s) to remain in school by offering transport and helping them with homework; providing transport for hospital appointments or collection of medication; and liaison between parents, social workers, and other care providers, including acting as an advocate where necessary.

Support is provided via home visiting volunteers, who meet with the family once a week to assist with various aspects of parenting, ranging from practical help in caring for the child, to the development of parenting skills, confidence and self-esteem. The visits are focused on increasing the independence of the family, emphasising the pleasures of family life, and reassuring parents that difficulties in bringing up children are not unusual.

The locality is situated near a number of watercourses which are showing an increased tendency to flood during bad weather, and the Team, made up of Adult BERT, Young BERT and BEV (Brockham Emergency Volunteers) were launched to undertake practical activities for prevention, crisis intervention and a focal point for aid in the event of such an emergency. The organisation is made up of three teams \u2013 Adult BERT (25 volunteers with specialist skills and equipment, able to undertake heavy work for extended periods), Young BERT (10 young volunteers, able to help lift and carry goods and sandbags and run errands) and BEV (25 volunteers, helping in a range of ways including comforting neighbours, liaising with insurance companies and emergency rental opportunities, staffing an evacuation centre and driving). The organisation has a management committee of 5. The Community Email run by the group has about 390 subscribers, including local police, other parishes and some businesses.

Orpheus was founded in 1998 by musician and entertainer Sir Richard Stilgoe. Orpheus established itself as an independent specialist college in 2012, which exists to promote independence for young disabled adults. The students engage in work experience in a variety of settings and are supported to continue this after moving on from the Centre. Orpheus specialises in performing and visual arts, offering an individualised holistic learning programme. Students are aged between 18 and 25 years and usually stay with the centre for 3 years. They learn subjects like English, Maths and IT alongside the arts and develop the skills to live independently and seek paid or voluntary work opportunities in arts-based or other industries. Orpheus offers a range of qualifications working with awarding bodies. There are 25 full time students living in independent flats, as well as around 25 day-students. Students are all motivated by the performing arts and have performed in venues including the Royal Opera House, Royal Albert Hall, Glastonbury Festival, Notting Hill Carnival, the Paralympic Opening Ceremony, and the Royal Festival Hall.",

As a result, The Hope Hub (THH) has been established to assist vulnerable people aged 18+ who are homeless, at risk of homelessness or otherwise vulnerable with a person-centred approach and will support each one positively empowering them towards independent living. THH will operate from Camberley, Surrey providing a pathway of services to individuals primarily within the Borough of Surrey Heath and surrounding areas. The aims of THH is to provide: H : Holistic range of services provided by qualified and trained staff and volunteers. O : Open access for all who need our services within the Borough. P : Person Centred. E : Empowering each person to move towards independent living. A Pathway of Services is to be offered managed by the Operations and Lead Case Worker. Volunteers will play a key contribution in the delivery of Crisis Support Services. Empowerment Services will be delivered by trained staff, specialists from other Agencies and in partnership with existing service provision within the Churches Together Camberley (CTC) Network but who lack a permanent and fit for purpose location from which to operate. The CTC Network services that will operate from THH include a weekly job club, 1:1 debt management/support, food support and free furniture. Service access and pathway progression will be captured and measured. Close working partnerships and recording of data with beneficiary permission will ensue with all statutory bodies and agencies to maximise individual progression. Case Studies will be captured (with permissions) each quarter. THH is responding to a need by providing a pathway of services leading to empowerment and renewed hope.

We bring together local schools, colleges and universities with their local care homes in creating exciting and meaningful music projects to improve well-being. We believe everyone should have the chance to live life to the full. Our intergenerational music programmes give \"targeted and identified\" children and older people the opportunity to do so. Working together they create music they can feel proud of, gain an increased sense of belonging and feelings of wellbeing. The Intergenerational music therapy projects benefit both the health and education sectors within the community as the work: shares cultural and musical understanding, increases the access to music-making, encourages informal music-making at homes, promotes sustainability by including volunteering and/or staff development and lastly raises self-confidence and self-esteem of participants. - All ages and all abilities at all stages of life. The company aims to seek out opportunities to facilitate meaningful connections and experiences through the medium of music. Everyone has the ability to respond to music, and music therapy uses this connection to facilitate positive changes in emotional wellbeing and communication through the engagement in live music interaction between client and therapist. It can help develop and facilitate communication skills, improve self-confidence and independence, enhance self-awareness and awareness of others, improve concentration and attention skills. At IMM are aims are: - Those experiencing social isolation and exclusion - Those experiencing limitation associated with illness, disability or trauma, for example those living with dementia, Parkinson\u2019s and other enduring health condition. - Local care-homes, nurseries, schools, children centres. - Creating important partnerships between the health and education sector. For example, linking and working closely with adult carers, support workers and care home staff plus teachers and SENCO\u2019s. Cross-disciplinary working. - Establishing relationships that help diminish the impact of declining physical and mental health on older people - Nurturing careers in health care and a lifelong commitment to volunteerism among youth. - Improving health outcomes and quality-of-life for the elderly - Building self-esteem and satisfaction for both age groups through the learning of new skills. We will work with identified (young and old) and targeted groups within Surrey to improve mental health and wellbeing whilst tackling loneliness and social exclusion. IMM intergenerational music programmes are designed to enhance the academic and behavioural outcomes for those identified school children at risk for poor academic achievement while simultaneously enhancing the health and well-being of older adult volunteers who work with them."

This is part of a wider evolution in the charity\u2019s work and focus over the past few years through their Lighthouse Project, that focuses on addressing poverty and empowerment in the community, and a partnership with Emmaus Rd Church in Guildford. Their current governing document still has the name \u2018Woking Vineyard Christian Fellowship\u2019 because the charity is preparing to shortly change from a Charity and Limited Company, to a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO), and with this will come a revision of our governing documents that will reflect the name change. \u2018Woking Vineyard Christian Fellowship\u2019 and \u2018Woking Vineyard\u2019 are still registered as operational names with the Charity Commission, so the current governing documents are still valid, although it understandably looks a little confusing to CFS and others when our grant submission documents mention multiple names. This includes the fact that \u2018The Lighthouse, Woking\u2019 is our primary public facing operational name, with \u2018Emmaus Transformation Trust\u2019 being the less visible name of the charitable organisation. The Lighthouse Centre is a charitable project managed by Emmaus Transformation Trust (ETT). The organisation was established in 1997 and The Lighthouse project was started in 2011. The Lighthouse has progressed from a derelict building to a vibrant hub to serve those who need fresh hope and practical support. Services include the foodbank, addiction recovery support (The Bridge Project), provision of clothing, toys and equipment (The Jigsaw Project), healthy-cooking classes, bread-making classes providing skills and a support network for vulnerable women, confidence coaching, free community lunches on Thursdays, Saturday breakfasts for the homeless, job interview preparation, youth mentoring, social enterprise opportunities, drama and music workshops, and much more. The Jigsaw Project has operated since 2006. It became too big to manage and hence The Lighthouse Centre was established, which now provides a multitude of services. The Lighthouse Centre has a Management Committee of 3 people including the pastor of the Woking Vineyard Church and his wife, 5 additional part-time workers, and 40 volunteers. However, the ETT as a charity has three unrelated Trustees.",

The charity was started in the early 1950\u2019s by a group of parents with children with cerebral palsy who recognised the need for a purpose-built treatment centre. Following a successful fundraising campaign, WLC was established on its current site in 1962. Current services include (for disabled children and teenagers) a parent and toddler group, nursery education, play/youth schemes, respite care; and domiciliary care. For disabled adults, services include courses in life and leisure skills, fitness courses, a specialist gym, a back care service for carers, and support groups for parents. Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, hydrotherapy as well as speech and language therapy are also available. This range of services is provided by the charity's 16 full-time and 60 part-time staff, with the support of over 120 volunteers. WLC is managed by 9 Trustees.",

                    "description": "We are a small charity set up to offer low cost counselling, educational workshops and community projects for the residents of our local community in Sedgemoor, with our headquarters based in Burnham-on-Sea. Somewhere House Somerset was born from the recognition that therapeutic services are not easily accessible to disadvantaged people. Cuts in government funding of mental health services has resulted in long waiting lists (with some waiting up to a year for an appointment). High costs to access private therapy means people on lower incomes are unable to seek support outside the NHS; this leaves individuals suffering alone and in distress. We aim to provide affordable therapy that is accessible to all ethnicities. What makes our services stand out, is that we ask our clients to pay what they can afford towards the cost of their counselling sessions. Our therapist are fully qualified and are members or accredited with BACP (British Association of Counselling Professionals). We follow BACP guidelines and ethics. Our counsellors meet local residents, children and young people, families, parents and lone parents, LGBTQ, victims of crime, violence and abuse, older people, individuals living in poverty, long-term unemployed, people with alcohol and substances misuse and addiction. The individuals we work with feel alone, misunderstood and not heard. They struggle with self-identity, masking their true feelings and experience difficulties in expressing themselves. Issues we help with are mental health difficulties, abuse, trauma, eating disorders, bereavement, anxiety, depression, loneliness, suicidal ideation, stress, bullying, PTSD, family dysfunction, relationship problems, parenting difficulties, substances and alcohol misuse. Our counsellors work to a person-centred approach, helping individuals perceive themselves more consciously whilst working towards meeting their full potential. The clients can talk through deeply personal feelings, find a different perspective and tools to manage difficult emotions; setting new goals and having the confidence to achieve them. Our charity also offers educational workshops. We saw a huge success and growth in 2018/19 for our interactive workshops that we run in schools and colleges; raising awareness on the risk of substances misuse and alcohol. We are fortunate to have volunteers who give their time freely, sharing deeply personal accounts of their lives in addiction, highlighting consequences and the damage caused to themselves, their families, friends and loved ones. Our aim is to pass the right information, so children and young people can make informed choices that are based in facts. Somewhere House Somerset also provides community projects. We believe that each person we support should have opportunities to develop relationships, learn new things and enjoy the activities they wish to do, we create supportive environments for the community and this is why we run community projects. We promote choice and inclusion and shape a service that is individual as they are. Becoming part of the local community enables individuals to live an active and inclusive life. Right now, we have a 5-a-side footie league that get together and have fun every Monday night. We run coffee mornings on a monthly basis and pub quiz every 6 months. The most important aspect of our work is that we bring long-term emotional, mental wellbeing and safety for the individuals we counsel. The work we conduct allows people to become more aware of the choices they make, resulting in creating greater awareness of the impact their behaviour has on each other, their friends, family and love ones. We have testimonials from clients that have used our service that can be evidenced upon request.",

Our consultation found that there was demand for a community centre. In order to address this finding and secure investment, Wilstockhub was founded as a Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG) with no share capital on 29 April 15. \u2022 Following its founding, Wilstockhub Trustees commissioned \u2018Locality\u2019, the national membership network for community organisations, to independently consult residents, assess needs and determine attendant cost and risk. Locality confirmed the demand for a community centre was the community\u2019s priority \u2013 a place all ages can meet and socialise, enjoy recreation and culture, and young residents can benefit from early years education. \u2022 To further its aims Wilstockhub became a registered charity on 22 June 2018. Its charitable objects benefit residents through its association with them, local authorities, voluntary and other organisations by advancing education and providing social welfare, recreation and leisure facilities for all residents. \u2022 Six trustees exercise collective governance, oversight and management of the CLG and registered charity which is Wilstockhub. Building Wilstockhub is a two phase project. Phase 1 will found the communal community space. Phase 2 will complete this building project. \u2022 The Wilstockhub Charity/CLG works with organisations to offer Wilstock and Stockmoor residents of all ages a varied programme of easily accessible and attractive community events and wellbeing activities year-round. 2.

                    "description": "ACSOS offers a friendship/befriending service for older adults; a low cost transport service (driver mileage reimbursement only) which offers lifts to and from medical appointments, shopping, day centres/clubs and visits to loved ones in hospital/homes, a \u2018handyman\u2019 service to provide assistance with small repairs along with information, wheelchair hire, hearing aid battery replacement, advice and signposting to other services and agencies. The friendship/befriending service seeks to provide comfort, friendship and practical help to residents in the borough of Southend-on-Sea and in Castle Point and Rochford who feel isolated or who need support in maintaining the lifestyle they wish to lead. In addition to providing company, weekly visits or telephone calls also enable the volunteer to monitor the well-being of the person being visited/called (the \"visitee\"). This is an invaluable service in that any signs of deterioration in the health of the visitee can be reported to the appropriate authority at the earliest possible stage. ACSOS currently befriends c.300 older people. The transport service provided by ACSOS has grown substantially over the past 5 years from c.600 lifts in 2013 to over 4,000 lifts in the past year. ACSOS receives no funding for this service, the only charge being a mileage charge of 47p per mile paid directly to our volunteer drivers. ACSOS has recently merged with Club 50+ CIO (reg. no. 1152184). The club provides health promoting activities such as tai chi, yoga and \u201ckeep fit\u201d classes as well as table tennis, short mat bowls, snooker and darts. It also provides line, modern ballroom, sequence and belly dancing tuition and offers lessons to help older people to improve their computer literacy and understand how to use the internet. Members can also play whist and bridge and there are facilities for them to develop skills in arts and crafts. As, due to age, many of its members are not as fit and active as they used to be the club tries to tailor its classes to meet their specific needs. For those that are less active and just want company, the club also has a \u201ctea bar\u201d where members can buy hot or cold drinks and light snacks. As most of its members are pensioners and many are on low incomes, the club has endeavoured to keep its charges as low as possible while trying to ensure that it can pay its bills. For example, charges for tutor-led activities (\u00a32.50 per session) and \u201ctea bar\u201d charges (50p for a cup of tea) are lower than those charged by most other activity clubs or cafes. These activities are much needed as, compared to the national average, Southend has: * a higher than average number of people over 65; * a higher percentage of older people living in deprivation; and * significantly more older people who live alone. Older adults in Southend on Sea are also 2.5% more likely to suffer with multiple long term health conditions than the rest of the UK. ACSOS has recently obtained planning permission from Southend Borough Council to convert the Grade II listed, Havens department store in Westcliff-on-Sea into a \"one-stop\" centre housing all of the facilities and services need by the older people of Southend and surrounding areas.The community hub is located in an area of Southend that houses a significant percentage of the older residents of the Borough many of whom are on low incomes. The hub will house not only ACSOS but also other local charities such as advocacy, bereavement support and services for those suffering from dementia. It will also house rooms for public health and social services and provide older people with chiropody, hairdressing and beauty treatment services. The hub will also include a caf\u00e9 which will offer hot and cold meals and drinks at a reasonable cost throughout the day and will be open to anyone. Club 50+, which has over 200 members, will be relocated to the first floor of hub from its current premises in Queens Road, Southend that is being converted into flats at the beginning of 2019. The hub will offer a range of regular \u2018pop up\u2019 services delivered by the Police, Fire Service, Peabody, Alzheimers Society and any other local organizations and charities who can offer services or information appropriate for the service users. There will be a number of opportunities for the sharing of experience and skills through inter-generational activities, for example, a \u201cMen's Shed\u201d will be in situ at the Hub which will offer people (both men and women) the chance to develop woodworking and metal working skills.",

What we intend to do to help make this happen (Our Aims) The prevention or relief of poverty in Colchester and the surrounding area, in particular, but not exclusively, by providing emergency food supplies to individuals in need and/or charities or other organisations working to prevent or relieve poverty. What we do (Our Mission) The Foodbank exists to prevent or relieve poverty in Colchester and the surrounding area, in particular, but not exclusively, by providing emergency food supplies to individuals with assessed short-term need and/or to charities or other organisations working towards the same aims. How we help (Delivering for the common good /public benefit) Colchester Foodbank provides short-term emergency support to individuals and families in a crisis within Colchester and the surrounding area, including Brightlingsea. We also work with other local food banks and regularly review our areas of coverage in response to need. To qualify for help, families and individuals must be referred by a professional from a partner organisation, such as Social Services, One Support, Community Mental Health Team, local housing groups, Citizens Advice Bureau and Age UK. We also work with Churches, Schools, GP Surgeries, philanthropic individuals and businesses. The need for referral to Colchester Foodbank is usually caused by a complex combination of events that may include factors like benefits delays, unemployment, illness and domestic violence. Where possible we refer or signpost people to relevant agencies, so they can get the additional help they need. This enables them to more fully understand the reality of their issues and how to get through them, seeking appropriate support and targeted transitional intervention. Also for us, to be able to monitor our longer term social impact. The way we behave while doing what we do (Our values) Colchester Foodbank is committed to community built on diversity, tolerance, cooperation, and mutual respect; we want to contribute to society and demonstrate social responsibility. Our values are important to us, and we aim to live them out in all areas of our work. We are passionate about what we do and the difference it makes in the lives of others We are compassionate; we give selflessly and put others before ourselves We hold ourselves accountable: we acknowledge and assume responsibility for actions, decisions, and consequences \u2013 as individuals and as an organisation. We are innovative, with the ambition to pursue new and creative ideas that have the potential to change lives for the better. We empower and encourage staff, volunteers and clients to take the initiative and achieve their best, in a safe environment where mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities. We provide three days\u2019 nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis.

We provide a small number of homeless parcels which include food items that don\u2019t require a kitchen including just add hot water packets (pot noodles/ porridge), ring pulled tins (fruit, ham, corned beef) our main partner agency in distributing these is Beacon House. Our parcels are generically made up but we then work with each client, to make them bespoke to their personal needs. Be it food that doesn\u2019t require cooking, gluten free, Kosher, Halal, vegetarian, vegan, apescatarian or if they just don\u2019t like something in particular we will remove it from the parcel and try to exchange it. We provide information about our services to school assemblies, voluntary organisations and at events. We offer guided tours and talks to scouts, schools and other interested parties. Between August 2016 and July 2017 the Foodbank provided 743 family parcels and 1879 standard parcels. This fed 6090 people, of which 3478 were adults and 2612 were children. We provide well over 200 emergency food parcels every month, feeding about 500 people every month. We also provide ingredients to support the charity food 4 kids, so they can bake cakes for children's birthdays. Two years ago, we provided individuals and families in crisis with three day emergency food parcels, specifically to support 4,919 people. Last year the demand for our service increased by 342, so we fed 5,261 people. This year, demand has increased by a further 507 people, so we fed 5,768 people.",

As part of this role we also encourage the forming of partnerships and collaborative working across Harlow and the wider voluntary sector. We currently co-ordinate 3 partnerships of statutory, private, and VCSE organisations working together to identify solutions to some of the most pressing problems facing communities within Harlow (Permitted Housing Developments; youth and anti-social behaviour; worklessness). We also work closely with Harlow Volunteer Centre and catalyse volunteering across Harlow. This includes through providing direct support to the Tempo Time Credits scheme, promoting it across communities and enabling our affiliates to sign up, providing training sessions and one off volunteering opportunities to earn Time Credits. - Rainbow Services provides direct services to the local community via our Community Builder project, which is currently supporting local older residents to identify and utilise personal and community assets to reduce social isolation and loneliness. We now support this programme across West Essex. We have also introduced a digital element to this and we are providing Digital Buddies to older residents to help them use technological solutions to maintain their independence and social networks. - Our Business Engagement project is working to facilitate a more structured approach to Corporate Social Responsibility and to create a better pipeline for business involvement and volunteering opportunities with the wider Voluntary Sector and local community. - Our Recycling Workshop currently offers 2 projects: the first is a contracted arrangement (with Sodexo) to provide a workplace environment for offenders who have received a community service order through the courts in an environment that is, whilst punitive, also rehabilitative and constructive. This project is the only community and voluntary sector run programme which Sodexo offers in Essex and is creating real opportunities for offenders to give back to their community by building and refurbishing items for local groups and organisations, whilst developing transferable skills which could lead to more positive activities on completion of their order. Service users from this project are involved in a new community venture with St Clare Hospice, upcycling donated furniture for resale in their stores across the region. The second project currently running from the workshop is for young people aged 14 - 18 who are disengaging from school and society and are at risk of crime, violence, gangs, drugs and anti-social behaviour. We offer supported positive activity sessions each week for up to 40 young people each year and accept referrals of from local schools, youth services, the local Community Safety Team and the Youth Offending team. The sessions provide positive, skills based activities supported by adults who have been screened and trained to help the young people learn new skills and positive behaviours through focused, mentored activity for 6 - 8 weeks. We act as a Hub for Youthbuild Essex in delivering 2 Gateway qualifications which young people can work towards. The young people make items for both themselves/their family (enabling them to develop self-esteem and showcase their achievements) and for local community projects for example bird and bat boxes for the local nature reserve (which they then put up and which they can take friend and family to see, developing self-worth and sense of community belonging). Rainbow has a well established reputation for delivering local projects individually and in partnership with others. Rainbow Services is the partner of choice for Harlow District Council and West Essex CCG in matters of community development and consultation, and we are currently supporting Essex Count Council to trial new methods of consultation with a pilot in Harlow. We have been asked by Harlow Council to co-ordinate a consultation into diverse communities.",

                    "description": "Street Pastors (SP) was introduce to provide a reassuring presence in the local communities. The whole ethos of SP is to listen, care, help and to engage with not only those who are out enjoying themselves within the night-time economy but also those who have found themselves in difficulties. We are trained volunteers from local churches who care about our community. We patrol in teams in town centres usually from 9pm to 2am on a Friday and/or Saturday night offering a helping hand to those who are in need on the streets. We seek to discourage anti-social behaviour by way of being a presence on the streets. This in turn decreases unnecessary call-outs to the emergency services allowing their time to be utilised elsewhere. We provide practical help, which includes handing out flip-flops to those in need, give out free bottled water and lollipops (which surprisingly has a way a diffusing potential altercations). We assist the homeless and rough sleepers with clothes, refreshments, sleeping bags or space blankets. We are called upon by some Councils and the Police to set up in areas which require our input. Alongside SP, new initiatives like Schools Pastors, Rail Pastors and Response Pastors which deal with major incidents assisting the Police and the emergency services/agencies are taking place throughout Essex and other areas. A number of our activities include, signposting individuals and those seeking help and advice to local support services and agencies. We take part in fundraising events to continue the work we are doing and to support those in need. We attend and are invited to various events/meetings run by the Council, the Voluntary sector, Police, Charities, local companies and organisations, we then provide awareness of the services we offer. Billericay Street Pastors (SP) was launched November 2013. We run and take part in outreach events at Summerfest, Soap Box Derby, Remembrance Day and the Christmas Markets. The Coordinator has regular meetings with the Police, Councils and other agencies tackling lower crime and making communities safer. We patrol twice a week on Fridays and Saturdays. We have built up strong links with the night time economy venue owners as a way of information sharing/gathering. Basildon Street Pastors - Launched August 2016. With the support of local Councillors, we were able to open a office space and we are also looking to provide a community hub in the Town Centre to facilitate various groups and offer a drop-in centre. It will signpost individuals/families to supportive services, alleviate suffering, help combat loneliness, homelessness and those disenfranchised from the community. We have had the opportunity of running an outreach tent as part of the 'Love your Borough Day' in Basildon Town centre and also Basildon MAYFEST. These are crucial events to heighten awareness of Street Pastors to different communities informing them we are here to help them. Southend Street Pastors - We attend public meetings which includes Love Southend events, Community in Harmony and the Faith Forum at the Civic Centre. The Coordinator also attends the Purple Flag meetings. Southend is one of the recipients of the Purple Flag, given by the Association of Town Centre Management. The scheme, similar to the Blue Flag for beaches, praised the town's high street and seafront for being \"welcoming, safe and clean\" and recipient of the Queens Award in 2015. Response Pastors - Our Response Pastors are active on the national database to respond to national crisis impacting our communities. Twelve are from Essex who work with the Police. Schools Pastors - This is to supply pastoral care within local Secondary schools. Links are well under way with 3 Projects. Two of these launched in 2018 at Billericay School and William De Ferrers school at South Woodham Ferrers. Cecil Jones School, Eastwood and Becket Keys in Brentwood are also in early stages of acceptance. This is a joint scheme between Schools Pastors, Council, Police, Church and other schools. Schools Pastors also assist with being a presence on routes home after school to discourage bullying and anti-social behaviour. Rail Pastors - This is the newly formed Project with research and ground work already carried out by the Coordinator which in turn has formed relationships with all interested parties along the C2C line and now the Abellio East Anglia in Essex. The Coordinator attends the Police and Communities Together (PACT) and route Crime monthly meetings. Preliminary meetings have taken place with C2C, Abellio East Anglia, Network Rail and British Transport Police (BTP) to secure a working framework and joined up services to support the work of this local Project. In-house Training - We have trained 24 Response Pastors, some of who have since be deployed nationwide to support communities with major incidents. We carry out county-wide recruitment and shared training sessions for newcomers, refresher training thus creating value for money. Regular meetings - These take place with the 12 Initiatives based in Essex at Police HQ to share best practices and being debriefed on current activities. To keep abreast of current trends, community/service knowledge and information sharing, a number of meetings are attended which is paramount to the continuation of providing an informative service to our communities and the public: Strategic Independent Advisory Group (SIAG) \u2013 The Coordinator is an active member of the SIAG and now the local Basildon IAG rep. These groups meet at Police HQ to monitor and advise the police on their community activity. The Coordinator has been active at the SIAG for nearly a year and will continue to be part of this group whilst funding allows. Emergency Resilience Forum (ERF) - This is also attended by Essex Street Pastors. The Joint Emergency Services Inter-operationally Programme (JESIP) forum for the ERF is also attended as we are now a recognised body in Essex as Response Pastors. Pubwatch - These groups in Billericay, Basildon and Southend forms part of the Night Time Economy patrols providing a cohesive platform which continues to share best practices.",

This support helps older people develop the confidence to speak up for themselves and voice concerns about issues affecting them. We provide generic advocacy ranging from finances and benefits, through to consumer complaints and disability issues. Many of the people we support have underlying issues such as dementia, ill health, disability and frailty as well as the immediate issues for which they seek our help. OCAY supports people to make decisions and implement solutions for themselves, rather than providing advice. We also signpost service users to other organizations in York, if their needs can be better met by another service. Our advocates support clients to access and use these other services if required. Clients need emotional and practical support. OCAY provides emotional support to manage the stress induced by issues such as making claims, which can aggravate existing health difficulties at the root of their claims. OCAY provides the practical support such as help with form filling and supporting at meetings such as assessments and tribunals. We want to achieve a position where all clients have the advocacy support they need and access to appropriate advice and support. We want to maintain timely responses for clients. In 2018/19, OCAY\u2019s staff of 3 (2.6 fte) and volunteer team of 26 supported 301 clients. So far in this financial year we have supported 325 people.",

We sing, chat and laugh with all of our participants who have come to rely on the service we provide. All of them are over 70 years of age and some are 90+. Many of them have chronic health conditions and most live alone. We have provided transport to our sessions to enable them to come along in the winter months and this was very much appreciated by them. The work we have done to combat loneliness and isolation cannot be measured - although judging by the feedback, comments and letter we have received over the past 4 years we know that a Musical Memories session means so much to all our participants and I am very concerned as to how they will fair without them. In summary - they will be heartbroken and lonely."

Since we were founded 11 years ago, we have established a track record of creating positive changes for children and young people who face challenges and empowering them to make their voices heard. This is evidenced by our growing list of referrals with many of our activities over-subscribed. Over the last year 435 children and young people accessed a SELFA activity, including wellbeing projects; holiday workshops and trips; and residentials. The school holidays can be particularly difficult for those who are socially isolated or have difficult home lives and SELFA helps to mitigate this with regular opportunities to meet other people, forge friendships and have fun. We offer lots of opportunities to develop confidence and self-esteem and gain independence through learning skills, trying new things and by taking on responsibilities as part of a task.",

We operate throughout the East Riding of Yorkshire and occasionally surrounding areas including Hull and York. All services are provided at no cost to participants, although employers may be charged for more comprehensive support. We deliver group workshops, in small peer groups of 4 - 6 people over four sessions, each lasting around three hours one day per week. The sessions are confidence building, assertiveness, anxiety management and recognising your skills. The workshops are delivered at various venues across the county. If group workshops seem too much for people, we sometimes offer a limited number of one to one support sessions for people, but this is as a lead in to joining the workshops, not counselling. Mental health is very important and we offer training and information for employers or other organisations on maintaining good mental health, and an overview of mental health problems and personality disorders. Holding on to paid employment is important for people and for employers. With huge costs to recruit, induct and train new staff, it makes far more economic sense to retain valuable employees rather than let them go because of the need for additional support. We offer bespoke training and information for employers. An introductory workshop is arranged followed by more intense workshops and cooperation if requested. This service may carry a nominal charge for companies, but it is very cost effective.",

A lack of confidence is one of the biggest challenges a person who has been diagnosed with sight loss faces. In response we deliver \u2018 Living with Sight Loss\u2019 courses. These are designed around a programme of workshops delivered by professionals to those who are newly diagnosed as blind or with serious sight loss and those who are experiencing a deterioration of an existing eye condition. These courses give knowledge, practical advice and boost confidence which, ultimately, enables people to deal with their sight loss in a more positive way. We offer a network of support, activities and friendship groups which are fully accessible to those who are blind. Through our regular social and activity groups, we enable our members to overcome the isolation and sense of exclusion often experienced as a result of the loss of sight. Our members can take part in fortnightly In-Touch groups which gives them the opportunity to meet up with old friends and to forge new friendships.",

Our volunteers receive ongoing supervision and training. All of our staff and team of volunteers are trained in safeguarding procedures. Once trained, volunteers are carefully assigned a family who they visit each week in their own homes for 2-3 hours. We aim to safeguard, protect and preserve good health, both mental and physical of parents and their children. To prevent cruelty to or maltreatment of children. To relieve sickness, poverty and need among parents and their children. To promote the education of the public in better standards of childcare.

From our Friday breakfast clubs to our food co-operative, as well as fundamental education around growing and cooking healthy food, we encourage residents\u2019 to improve their diet at low cost, which has lasting health benefits, whilst also encouraging social interaction and imparting skills that residents can build on to gain employment, for example.

Based in Woking, services include an 11-bed emergency night shelter, 18 beds in four separate \u2018move on\u2019 properties supporting a variety of needs, and a Day Centre which provides advocacy, education and training opportunities, and social activities for clients four days per week. YRP aims to provide more than just a roof, but to offer an holistic support package (including accommodation) to address the reasons behind clients\u2019 homelessness. Clients face a range of issues, including addiction, relationship breakdown, unemployment, mental or physical health issues, poor literacy and numeracy, English as a second language, care background, offending, debt and social isolation. The charity considers that education and life skills are paramount in supporting clients to make changes to their lives as a roof alone does not solve all of the problems relating to homelessness. In addition to the training and other services provided, the charity is able to signpost clients to specialist services where appropriate, and also provides help with clothing, travel costs, ordering identification, reconnecting clients with their local area, and assisting clients into employment or volunteering opportunities. YRP currently employs 10 full-time and 8 part-time members of staff and is governed by a Board of 8 Trustees and supported by 8 volunteers. In the nine months to 31 March 2014, the charity saw 1,125 people attending the Day Centre sessions, which led to increased opening hours. 45 individuals were rehoused and 47 helped with benefits, and 66 certificates awarded for a range of skills including IT, Food Hygiene, CSCS and First Aid. The night shelter had an occupancy rate of 95.6% with emergency accommodation offered to 166 individuals. 68.1% of clients are new to homelessness and over half of the clients were forced to sleep rough before accessing the shelter. 30.1% of shelter clients were able to be resettled into secure and appropriate accommodation. Update (June 2016): The charity is also now operating a bigger Day Centre provision, in premises in Goldsworth Road (opposite the Job centre) - open from 7:30am for rough sleepers, providing advice, workshops, skills training and activities promoting wellbeing and self-esteem. (Woking Borough Council funded the refurbishment of this Centre). Growth in the last 4 years - has been by utilising external consultants, to build the skills of the team, to take forwards (i.e. sustainable and cost-effective route). A local chef recently ran a masterclass for clients, one of whom is now engaged in a work experience opportunity.",

Volunteers offer support in various forms including shopping, dog walking, respite care, listening, and transport to hospital appointments. A volunteer may also be a point of liaison between client and social services. The Trust works in close partnership with local service providers and communities, receiving referrals from local hospices, District Nurses, Community Matrons, GPs, hospitals, social services, voluntary organisations, and churches. Some clients also self-refer. Each year, TBT helps around 170 individuals and their families. Over 80% of clients have cancer, and around 5% have had a stroke or other neurological problem. 86% are over the age of 65 and 57% live alone.",

The helpline is open between 7.30 and 10pm on Tuesday and Sunday evenings and offers advice and guidance on all areas surrounding sexual orientation including sexual health, inter-personal relationships, equal opportunities and discrimination. Support is also offered via email for those who are unable to contact Outline during the helpline opening hours and the service is manned by a total 14 volunteers working from their own homes. Although the service is based in Surrey, Outline accepts calls from the whole country, however the majority are from the Surrey area. People contact Outline for a number of reasons ranging from worries about coming out to friends and family, to advice on how to meet like-minded people in the LGBT community. Outline aims to provide a non-judgemental and supportive service to all callers, whether they are from the LGBT community themselves or are calling from the perspective of a concerned friend or relative. The helpline is manned solely by volunteers and calls are charged at a local rate. The helpline was originally initiated by the Surrey Care Trust, however Outline took control of the service as a separate voluntary entity shortly after. Despite this, Surrey PCT have provided regular grant funding in recent years to assist with the running costs of the charity. An NHS Sexual Health Development Worker also attends committee meetings on a regular basis and helps to secure on-going funding from the PCT. Since July 2010, Outline has also run a monthly social group for LGBT individuals in Woking to meet, socialise and provide each other with support. To date, the group has met on two occasions, with over 35 people attending across both meetings. There are currently 6 members on the Management Committee, which is comprised of LGBT representatives. The international celebrity, George Michael, is the patron of the charity and has often donated substantial sums of money to support it's development.",

Our mission is to enable people with learning disabilities to live aspiring lives. We are a highly experienced supported living provider, with a local / regional base focused on community, well-being and excellence, which enables people to be independent, active, safe and included. We support over 300 people with learning disabilities, physical disabilities, sensory impairment, mental health needs, autism and behaviours of concern in their homes, individual flats or shared houses. Our Head Office is in Reigate and our services are mostly based in East Surrey, although we have recently expanded into West Sussex and Croydon. However, if we are successful with our application, the grant will solely be spent for the benefit of Surrey residents. Active Prospects has an unwavering commitment to co-production, giving people a voice at the heart of our organisation. Our award-winning co-production body, the Pro-Active Community, is a 300 strong user-led organisation and plays an important role in peer-led service improvement; social activities and inclusion; community involvement; and being active citizens. The Pro-Active Community elect a committee, who meet fortnightly. The committee are responsible for direction and priorities (including business and service development), performance, partnership creation and other key strategic matters. They are currently in the process of registering as their own an independent charity. Every quarter the Pro-Active Community hold a forum called the Surrey People's Group where anyone is free to come along and participate in workshops and discussions surrounding topics that the committee have identified as being important to or significantly impacting people with Learning Disabilities, Autism or Acquired Brain Injury in Surrey. The invite is also extended to local Commissioners and service providers to help ensure that everyone has an opportunity to get their voice heard. It's a great opportunity for everyone to work together, learn and socialise. Alongside the Pro-Active Community we have trained people we support to be Quality Checkers. They provide Pro-Checking: visiting other services, speaking to people and reviewing evidence against service standards and approaches. Their feedback is used to share best practice as well as set improvement actions. Our people are now peer quality checking other organisations and Surrey County Council services, this provides an income stream for the individuals involved. Supporting people to find paid employment is a top priority for both Active Prospects and the Pro-Active Community and helps to reduce reliance on the benefits system. People we support are also routinely involved in staff recruitment and appraisals. The Pro-Active Community are regularly invited to sit on interview panels for Surrey County Council posts and people focus groups have previously reviewed handbooks, looked at dignity issues and looked at disability/inclusivity design. All of this enriches the lives of the people we support and is demonstrated in the fact that 100% of people we support have made positive progress in their outcome goals over the last year."

A key objective is to promote the work within local communities where there are known pockets of deprivation or adults over the age of 17 years on low incomes. Most of the referrals are from the Boroughs of Woking, Runnymede and Elmbridge. The Counselling Partnership (TCP) is also now receiving referrals from neighbouring boroughs within Surrey. Since establishing, TCP has received over 3,500 referrals, either directly from clients or via health and social care professionals. Referrals are increasingly received from carers via Carer Support organisations and from Victim Support. Beneficiaries are asked to make a minimum contribution of \u00a320 per session (much less than private counselling services), however the charity offers subsidies to those who find this financial commitment prohibitive. Counselling sessions are held in a variety of community venues including Walton Community Hub, Cobham Day Centre and Maybury Centre in Woking, and are facilitated by trained counsellors who work for the charity as volunteers. TCP is engaged with around 20 volunteers who are each committed to providing at least 3 hours counselling per week, for a minimum of one year. The volunteer counsellors receive supervision and mentoring, and Counsellors are also given the opportunity to use their work with the charity to accrue client hours which are required to complete professional qualifications such as the British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy qualifications. TCP employs 2 part time staff and is governed by 9 Trustees",

ER supports single homeless people who are not entitled to statutory support and are termed \u2018non-priority\u2019. Their only housing option is the private rental sector, but they face multiple barriers to achieving this e.g. a lack of savings for deposits or rent in advance, physical and mental health issues, addiction problems, and unemployment. They also have difficulty in finding a landlord willing to accept them. Each client is assessed by trained staff, who then work to find an immediate solution (often in terms of access to emergency accommodation for a few weeks, while working to find the right longer-term housing). ER helps people into employment and encourages them to join the ER savings scheme, enabling them to save a protected pot of money that they can use for a deposit for a property of their own once they are ready to move on from ER\u2019s support. Over the last year ER have given advice to 384 vulnerable people and have gone on to house 154 clients. Of the 154 housed: 31% had been rough sleepers, 45% have mental health issues, 7% have a criminal record, 29% have drug and/or alcohol issues. In the last year 28% of clients started work and 32% started to save each month towards their own future. Nov 2019",

A Befriending Service is also offered, along with transport, social outings and shopping trips. The Men\u2019s Shed is the newest service to be offered.

Support for children with brain injury and neurodisability is provided in three key areas: \u2022 In 1985 The Children\u2019s Trust started the UK's first paediatric brain injury rehabilitation service and today runs the country\u2019s largest service of its kind.

We provide support that is focused on the needs of each individual, helping them to move forward with their lives. Our support includes work experience on our enterprise businesses, access to training and adult education, homelessness prevention support, housing projects for rough sleepers and ex-offenders, sports and social activities and access to paid jobs with inclusive employers. Last year we supported over 2,000 people in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Aspire is a founder member of Oxford Homeless Movement and runs a range of programmes designed to prevent and tackle homelessness. We run a homelessness prevention programme which gives people the skills, confidence, knowledge and connections to prevent their own homelessness. We run Housing First projects in collaboration with local housing associations. In all of Aspire's programmes, we ensure that people with lived experience are involved at every stage, including co-designing the projects that we run and in 2019 helped to establish Oxfordshire's first Lived Experience Forum.",

                    "description": "- Providing hospice care for Somerset St Margaret\u2019s Hospice Care provides high-quality responsive care for families in Somerset when someone is given a diagnosis of a life-limiting illness. We have a vision of a community in which all dying people and those close to them have access to appropriate care and support, when they need it, wherever they need it and whoever they are. Our aim is to bring quality of life to patients and their families, carers and friends so that they can make each day count. Across Somerset we offer a range of services: \u2022 Our Community Teams provide care and support in the familiar environment of a patient\u2019s own homes. The community teams provide care for over 260 patients at any one time. \u2022 Our 24 hour referral and advice line receives an average of 786 calls per month from patients and carers who need advice from a palliative care nurse and health professionals wishing to make a referral. \u2022 Our Sunflower Centre Day Services welcomes attendees who are well enough to live at home but who want to take advantage of our specialist care available through the day. The Sunflower Centre also provides respite for carers. \u2022 Our In-patient Unit in Taunton offers patients with complex care needs comfortable surroundings where they receive extra support, symptom control and pain management from specialist teams. \u2022 Our Outpatients Services provide a wide range of therapies including Lymphodema Treatment, Physiotherapy, Complementary Therapies, Occupational Therapy, and Psychotherapy. \u2022 Our Bereavement Services supports families and carers who have lost a loved one to a life-limiting illness. Our Family Support Worker is specially trained to help children and young people cope with the loss of a parent. \u2022 Our support groups offer an opportunity for people to meet with people going through a similar experience. Our carer support services come alongside those caring for their loved ones who have a life-limiting illness. \u2022 Our Spiritual Care Team work closely alongside clinical teams to ensure we are caring for patients\u2019 spiritual needs alongside their physical and emotional needs. - Adapting to meet future care needs With over 5,500 people dying in Somerset each year and an estimated 4,000+ people who would benefit from hospice care, we know that there is a growing gap between those we can help and those we are currently unable to reach or support adequately. Over the last couple of years, St Margaret\u2019s has therefore been rethinking how we can improve our reach across the county, address a current national shortfall in medical staffing and respond to patient choice by extending our care within the community, enabling patients to receive end-of-life care closer to home \u2013 while all the time ensuring that we remain financially sustainable. The Board of Trustees have recently confirmed that St Margaret\u2019s will increase our work in the community. Providing end of life care closer to home, while ensuring specialist care is available for those who need it across Somerset, are key components of St Margaret\u2019s strategy. This focus enables our teams to support patients and families in the community in a more proactive way, being able to plan care in advance with patients in their own homes about what their future needs might be. We will increasingly work alongside NHS and adult social care community teams to anticipate and prepare for the changing needs that our patients may have. In-patient services will remain a key component of St Margaret\u2019s and we will bring beds together on one site in Taunton, to reduce the ongoing challenge of maintaining sustainable medical staffing with appropriate skills. Our own patients tell us they would prefer to be at home and we want to make sure this can be achieved. However, we understand that this can put an incredible amount of pressure on carers and families. By extending our community provision we can help support other healthcare providers, families and carers to meet the wishes of the patient while feeling safe and supported. St Margaret\u2019s Hospice Care\u2019s strategy is to further increase this in the coming years. Alongside this we are also developing work to encourage early referrals to the hospice. Often people come to the hospice later on in their illness. However, if we can provide opportunities for people with a life-limiting illness to access hospice care earlier we will be able direct them towards activities and support which will assist in improving the quality of their life. This will enable them to remain in control in their home environment, adapting as their health needs change. - Are you sitting comfortably? We would like the Active Living Programme to consider supporting us so that we can offer something new to our patients. The aim of our project is to provide staff and volunteers with the skills to integrate seated exercise into the services currently provided by the Hospice. We believe that this will improve patient's physical and mental wellbeing. By training our staff and volunteers we will have an ongoing and sustainable resource to benefit patients beyond the period of the grant. The seated exercise programmes will be integrated into our existing day hospice provision to enhance the care and subsequent benefits of the service to patients. St Margaret\u2019s Hospice is one charity for the people of Somerset, caring and supporting patients and their families and carers. This new focus will ensure that the charity is in the best possible shape to continue providing high quality, responsive care for more people facing a life-limiting illness across Somerset in the months, and years, to come.",

                    "description": "The aims of Nourish - Bumps, Babies and Breastfeeding are to protect, promote and support breastfeeding within the community of Bridgwater and the surrounding villages. Nourish provides a weekly support group, held in Cannington, offering pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers the opportunity to seek support, information and empathy in a non-clinical environment for a small donation. Up until January 2018 the group had been funded by NCT (National Childbirth Trust) and was called NCT Cannington Bumps, Babes and Breastfeeding group. Unfortunately due to funding constraints facing the charity, the NCT could not continue to financially support the group. Thus the breast feeding counsellor leading the service and a handful of passionate and dedicated breastfeeding peer supporters decided to establish the group Nourish to enable the continuation of pregnancy, baby and breastfeeding support service. Support and information about breastfeeding is provided within Nourish by a qualified Breastfeeding Counsellor and trained Breastfeeding Peer Supporters. Women are often referred to the group by midwives and health visitors requiring specific support for breastfeeding, whilst others find the group from publicity such as Facebook, flyers or word of mouth. The group aims to provide a warm, friendly, open environment where women feel safe and secure to express their emotions and seek support to enable them to have a positive breastfeeding experience. As Nourish is free from the constraints of a clinical setting and the pressures on health professionals, we are able to give mothers unlimited time, to listen and offer mother-led support. This enables families to make informed decisions and have a positive experience with breastfeeding. Although Nourish offers support and information about breastfeeding a mother does not need to have an issue directly relating to breastfeeding to attend. All too often a mother needs the emotional support of other mothers to ward off feelings of isolation, anxiety or to simply discuss their trials and tribulations of parenthood whilst establishing friendships. In this way the group positively supports not only breastfeeding but the varied and sometimes challenging experiences of parenting. The group welcomes older siblings attending with their mother so that mothers with subsequent children are included within our reach. Toys and activities are provided to entertain older sibling so that their mother can spend time talking to other mums or seeking support from the peer supporters or breastfeeding counsellor. Refreshments such as tea, coffee and cake help a mother feel relaxed and welcome as well as providing much needed calories to meet the demands of nourishing her baby. We positively welcome the attendance of partners/husband alongside their breastfeeding partner/wife as women who have support to breastfeed from family members feel empowered to continue their breastfeeding journey when faced with challenges. Overall the group's aim is to nourish women, both physically and emotionally, to enable them to have a positive breastfeeding experience."

                    "description": "The Willow Set Preschool and Sun Up, Sun Down Club is located in Stoke St Gregory approximately 12 miles fromTaunton, Bridgwater, Langport and Street. It is a rural village that includes families from a wide range of backgrounds including the farming industry, Clarks, Hinkley Point and of course willow growing businesses. The setting opened approximately 35 years ago in the church rooms and is now, after hard work and fundraising, situated on the primary school site. We are a committee run preschool with charity status also offering wrap around care. I have managed and run the preschool and wrap around care setting for over 22 years. The wrap around club has only been open just over 5 years and is growing as the need from working parents increases. My aim is to continue to provide outstanding facilities to nurture the children aged 2-11 yrs and provide a rich safe environment with outstanding inside and outside facilities. We also now run a holiday club which has highlighted an obvious need in the community as many of the days over the last six weeks have been at capacity, we again offer outstanding experiences for children to grow and have fun. The project will enable us to offer more for all the children who attend all our 3 settings. I also organise an annual free play evening every for every child, especially as we have families with some diverse needs. Each child will comes with an adult , this has numerous positives as I want parents/carers involved in all we are doing. Firstly to supervise, thus ensuring safety, but really to engage themselves and have fun with all the children. The ethos of the event is to involve parents and promote social cohesion across preschool, wrap around care and outlying organizations and supporting the understanding that Play refers to a collection of voluntary, intrinsically motivated activities that are usually associated with PLEASURE and enjoyment.Or FUN. This is an outside event providing healthy foods to explore and eat will support those families in need of this help. We have a number of disadvantaged children in the village and outlying areas, therefore this being a free evening makes it available to all regardless of their backgrounds. As a setting we work with other organisations in and around the village as we feel every child is important and deserves the best experiences throughout their childhood.",

                    "description": "Seed of Hope CIC is a Social Enterprise offering Recovery based Social and Therapeutic Horticulture for people with mental health problems. We are based in The Walled Gardens of Cannington and supported in kind by Bridgwater and Taunton College who provide horticultural expertise and facilities. We currently run one day a week on Tuesdays. Our main sessions provide a six hour day of mixed horticultural activity, a yoga lesson and a Recovery group. The therapeutic horticultural activity is tailored to the varied levels of physical ability in the group. We pace the activity throughout the day and take regular breaks. We use the elements intrinsic to horticulture - Being outdoors in nature, increased light levels, working as part of a team towards a common goal, nurturing living plants and environments, gentle exercise and Hope - to deliver improved mental and physical well-being for our participants. Our yoga sessions are offered as a tool for participants to use in day to day life to aid relaxation and improve physical ability. It also serves as a physical warm up prior to our horticultural activity. The Recovery group is based on the format devised by Dr Abraham Lowe in the 1920s and used for many years by Recovery international. Participants share their experiences, support each other and explore the concepts of Recovery. Participants also have the opportunity to gain a level 1 qualification in Practical Horticultural Skills awarded by City and Guilds and assessed by the college. Seed of Hope CIC has three sources of income1-Trading income - Our main product is our horticultural sessions which are paid for through personal health or social care budgets. We also sell a variety of products both online and through the Walled Gardens of Cannington shop. These include household items and garden planters made from upcycled pallet wood, wildflower seeds (Seeds of Hope) and plants that have been grown by participants. We are also plan on expanding our groups to people with dementia and people experiencing work related stress. 2- Projects - Our projects have three aims- to provide a goal for our participants, to improve community green spaces, and to provide income. Our award winning Spring Orchard project was completed in 2017 and we are currently working on the Cannington Church Gardens of Rest. Our design for this project was a finalist in the Church Times Green Church Awards 2017. 3- Grant income- As a Social enterprise we aim to be less reliant on this source of income than the other two. However at this start-up phase of our development we need grant funding to support us whilst we grow and develop. Seed of Hope CIC is set up as a Social Enterprise as opposed to a charity for two main reasons. We believe that the current dominant systems of service provision in mental health take power away from service users. Power is an important factor in a person's Recovery. Setting up as a charity implies that people with mental health problems require charity to help them rather than having the power to work co-operatively in their Recovery. Secondly being in control of the source of our income and how it is spent allows us to maintain our independence as an organisation. This is important to us because it means we do not have to work in ways which we know don't help people with mental health problems in their Recovery journey. Being a CIC allows us to work as a co operative. Everyone who takes part in Seed of Hope CIC can become a member of the CIC entitling them a vote on company policy and strategy. Our founding principles are enshrined in our articles of association, these are- 8.1 Recovery - Seed of Hope CIC is a Recovery based organisation. 8.2 Mental Health - Seed of Hope CIC is concerned with the mental health of participants. We are not convinced by the scientific evidence and through our own experience, of the existence of Mental Illness. This does not discount an individual\u2019s experience of psychological or emotional distress, or the negative impact of this on a person\u2019s life. 8.3 Pay Equality\u2013 Seed of Hope CIC will value the contribution of all employees regardless of seniority in the organisation. Seed of Hope CIC will be a co-operative organisation, and as such will cap the maximum pay of any employee to two and a half times that of the lowest paid employee. 8.4 Membership- Every participant will be offered the opportunity to contribute to the governance of the organisation as a Member as defined in these articles. 8.5 Intrinsic Elements-The main activity of Seed of Hope CIC is Social and Therapeutic Horticulture. The main elements of which are shown through research to provide positive outcomes for the participants. Seed of Hope CIC will also carry out activities that provide some or all of the intrinsic elements for participants. 8.6 Diversity of Income-To maintain the independence of Seed of Hope CIC which may be compromised by a disproportionate reliance on any one stream of income. Income will be sought from all of the following sources-Grants, Trading Income, Payment by Participants, Fundraising Activity, Commissioned Activity. 8.7 Participant Director- It is of paramount importance to Seed of Hope CIC to have a Participant Director on the Management Team. In order for them to carry out their role all reasonable adjustments will be made to the organisations arrangements for meetings of the Management Team. 8.8 Humour- Mental Health problems can be both life limiting and life threatening. There is much sadness and distress involved in the lives of those experiencing mental distress. Seed of Hope CIC will at all times work in a positive hopeful way and this includes the use of humour at all levels of our interactions. The intention of this is to raise spirits, reflect on the irony of situations, maintain and promote hope and mental well being. It is not intended to harass, belittle, distress, discriminate, bully or intimidate.",

Provide equality for residents of Glastonbury and its surrounding areas who want support for mental ill health or emotional issues by offering affordable and easy access to therapeutic services. We believe in offering choice for individuals who are on a journey of self-help and exploration, meaning people can work with therapeutic methods that suits them best. Our services currently include low cost counselling, eco-therapy, group and art therapy support. 2. Nurture students by providing practical learning experiences for the next generation of counsellors and therapists who are training for their qualifications. We set the trust up because we saw an increase in people suffering who were not able to get access to professional support for their mental health. This was due to obstacles including long waiting lists, cancellations, long distant treatment, high costs associated to private therapy. The increasing demand for professional therapeutic support has put a significant strain on local services. Our aim is to help alleviate some of the burden experienced by local GP\u2019s, schools, local charities, since they are struggling to support the need for help from people relating to mental health struggles.",

In Shepton Mallet we provide many varied services from children's activities to work with the homeless. Our weekly programme consists of two parent and toddler groups, a community drop in with a job club. A digital link club offering both internet access to look and apply for employment, help to provide support with basic computing knowledge, and helping people understand IT when apply for benefits and pay bill's. We also run a Community lunch club which is attended by people who are either looking to get out of the house for a bit of company, people dependant on alcohol and other substances or in some cases for people who don't have enough money to buy food. We also run a club for older people in our community that meets once a week providing them with a place to come and chat with each and share in the activities that we put on. A Brass band for children from the age of 9 upwards. Once a month on a Saturday we run a family craft activity with a cooked meal, to encourage the whole family to spend time together. We have a Charity Shop attached to our building which offers us are only real source of income, and also allows us to be open throughout the week to meet the needs of our community. One of the biggest parts of our work in the community though is the running of the local food bank. over the last twelve months we have given away over 400 food parcels providing food for families or individuals when they cant afford it. The food bank is run on a referral basis and we work closely with agencies, both professional and voluntary, so that we are not just simply handing out food but helping to deal with the underlying need of why the service users do not have enough money to buy it. Along side the food bank we run a Christmas appeal. Again this takes referrals from agenesis of families who without help for what ever reason could not have afforded Christmas. We do around seventy Christmas food hampers and provide toys for over one hundred and fifty children.",

Food is donated by members of the public at drop-off points including local churches, Waitrose, Sainsburys and Starbucks and then sorted and stored in the charity\u2019s warehouse space. The foodbank is open every Friday from 12.00-1.30pm at the Methodist hall on Cedar Road, Cobham. People are referred to the foodbank by social services or other professionals who provide a voucher to demonstrate that they are in need. Food for three days is given in a size which is appropriate for the size of the family and support is also provided via a friendly word over a cup of tea by volunteers who can also support with signposting clients to other services The foodbank has no staff, but around 60 volunteers and a committee made up of 8 individuals.",

At present the Church has a number of projects in progress: weekly engagement with each of the local primary and secondary schools, a free-to-access sports camp for 8-16 year olds in each of the school holidays, a weekly community breakfast alongside the East Elmbridge Foodbank, an emergency winter night shelter and a youth drop in cafe, which operates on Mondays and Thursdays between 3.30pm and 6pm each week. Historically there has been both the PCC and a Charitable Trust which supported the work of St Peter\u2019s Church. The Trust was a joint venture with another Church but increasingly it was deemed that it was too complicated to have both the PCC and the Charitable Trust, and the Trust therefore ceased on 31st March 2019. St Peter\u2019s Church is not yet certain how much will be distributed from the Trust to St Peter\u2019s.",

We will be working with YMCA East Surrey and Redoak Centre for the benefit of local youngsters with disabilities and learning difficulties for providing cookery classes. We will be using Fairshare, to utilise surplus food to feed mouths cheaply. The caf\u00e9 will be in the centre of a Community Hub on the Merstham Estate. All 4 Directors of the CIC are local...1 being a Borough Councillor for the area, and one a retired Borough Councillor. The other 2 are also associated with a local charity called Loveworks who operate a Foodbank in the Hub where the caf\u00e9 will be located. Another local councillor is on the Steering Committee and a further member runs free support groups for those troubled by addiction within the local area. Also on the committee is a member of Redoak, providing support to disabled youngsters. 2 of our number are Trustees of the Merstham Facility Community Trust who will have a presence in the Hub where the caf\u00e9 is situated. Any profits from the caf\u00e9 will be used to provide extra community services to supplement their work in providing IT Training, Job Search, Uniform Swap and other community based activities. All the volunteers will be recruited locally and already help to run a one day per week hot meal pop up free service for locals. the local YMCA and Redhill colleges will be involved in the training kitchen. A survey has shown how much the local people feel the need and would like to be involved in our project."

                    "description": "Big Leaf Foundation was established in 2018 in response to the unmet needs of displaced young people in Surrey. Having fled conflict and persecution, displaced young people in the UK face huge barriers to accessing education, support and employment and, most importantly, in finding a community. We aim to address this through supporting vulnerable and isolated young people (aged 16-25) into education and employment and providing a programme therapeutic and community-focused activities that will enable them to build a fulfilling life in the UK and flourish in their new home. We want the young people we work with to be excited about the opportunities available to them, and to value their unique talents and abilities so that they can rediscover their potential and move forward with renewed optimism. Through our projects we also aim to provide the space for young people to build trusted relationships with those around them so that they might begin to feel a sense of home and hope and be less vulnerable to negative external influence or self-destructive behaviour. Our projects include: \u2022 HUB \u2013 our weekly drop-in sessions for displaced young people living in Surrey. We provide ESOL support, help with homework, conversation, activities and games and a hot supper. It\u2019s also a chance for young people to ask any questions they might have about life in the UK and meet other people for the community around them. Food is freshly prepared and halal and everyone sits down and eats together. \u2022 I SPEAK MUSIC RADIO PROJECT \u2013 our new project in partnership with Surrey Arts and Kane FM is a combined academic and music project built around English language, music and broadcast studio skills. Sessions focus on increasing participants\u2019 use of English, working together on song-writing and emphasising self-expressions through personal choice of musical and lyrical style, and learning a musical instrument. \u2022 SUMMER CAMP \u2013 our annual five-day summer camp at the beautiful Trill Farm in Devon is a chance for our young people to relax, to take a break from their worries, to eat well, sleep well, experience something new, be outside and have fun. There\u2019s a packed programme of activities encompassing everything from woodwork, pottery and leatherwork to organic gardening, falconry and equine therapy with games, music and campfires in between.

It offers helps clients to put their finances in order by managing any debts, securing benefits to which they are entitled, and obtaining grants or services from charities. EECA is based in Epsom, but staff will be able to see clients at convenient locations across all four boroughs covered.

The charity also works on research and campaigning to bring about necessary changes to policies and practices that affect clients\u2019 lives.

We aim to help our members access the latest information about services and support for Disabled People in Surrey and to provide training to use and access to information about various technologies. The main activities of the organisation are: Co-production and Engagement, Technology and Innovation, Wider Determinants of Health education, Influencing and Mental Health. Co-production and Engagement Surrey Coalition is the central point of contact for co-production activities with the Disabled community in Surrey. We organise groups for people with impairments of all types to come together to enable commissioners and service providers to work with end-users to better design services. We run regular groups such as Surrey Vision Action Group, a Long Term Neurological Conditions Group and a Hard of Hearing Forum as well as bespoke groups on request. Technology and Innovation We maintain a 'demonstration suite' of technology for our members to try and to learn with to improve wider social and health outcomes. Alongside devices, we demonstrate various apps like Google Live Transcribe and Mental Health apps. We run technology pilot projects that will benefit Disabled people and Carers. A current project we are coordinating if called TESH (Technology Enabled Smarter Homes) and our next pilot is starting in the East of the County soon and is called Tech to Community Connect. It will explore the use of technology in reducing loneliness and isolation for Disabled people and Carers. Wider determinants of Health education We work in collaboration with other organisations such as the NHS and Social Care to promote services and support available and to deliver key health messages. We work with organisations like Active Surrey Disability to support projects that will make Physical Activity more accessible to Disabled People. Influencing We work to influence locally and Nationally to improve accessibility and inclusion for Disabled people. As an example, National work with NHS England to improve the accessibility of the NHS 111 service for people with a Hearing Impairment. We run a series of 'Lets Loop Surrey' visits to highlight local issues with accessibility and to help the organisation to make their business or service more accessible. Mental Health We regularly communicate Mental Health information to our membership including sources of support and developments to services in Surrey. As people who are Disabled or who have a Long Term Health Condition (LTHC) are much more likely to experience Mental ill-Health, it is important that services are accessible to everyone so we ensure that we keep on top of new and existing services. We coordinate the Independent Mental Health Network (IMHN) for the Surrey and NE Hants area and we have a contract with Surrey and borders NHS Partnership Trust to deliver the FoCUS (Forum of Carers and people who Use Services) network.",

One key service which Age Concern Woking provides is a befriending scheme whereby volunteers make regular visits to the homes of older people. This service has been running for many years and currently supports over 50 people on an ongoing basis. The charity also runs a \u2018Home from Hospital\u2019 service to support elderly people who have recently returned from hospital, to ensure that they settle back home and are receiving all the help they require; as well as an Emergency Assistance service, which currently receives around 20 referrals per month. An information and sign-posting helpline is also provided for elderly people in need of advice and guidance in respect of a range of issues such as local services and social welfare. This telephone line answers queries from around 90 callers per month. Age Concern Woking also provides a fire risk check programme, in partnership with Surrey Fire and Rescure Service, through which trained volunteers help to keep older people safe by carrying out home fire safety checks and installing smoke detectors where necessary. All of the services offered by Age Concern Woking are available free of charge. The charity currently has a management committee comprised of 8 people and 4 part-time members of staff. Approximately 77 volunteers assist the charity on an ongoing basis.

There are 60 Live at Home Schemes across the country, operating under the MHA charity umbrella. However, each Scheme operates autonomously, is guided by an elected Committee of local people (including Members, volunteers, supporters) and is required to self fund. MHA Reigate and Redhill Live At Home Scheme was set up in 1997 and is a local Surrey-based service, which operates from an office base in Redhill Methodist Church. It supports older (60+) people who are living in their own homes to feel a renewed sense of purpose and belonging within their communities. The organisations aims are to maintain independent living, improve well-being and reduce isolation. It runs a diverse programme of activities, which focus on enhancing a positive outlook, promoting independence and building strong friendships and social networks. MHA offer accessible and affordable weekly day clubs in Horley, Redhill and Reigate, monthly coffee mornings and escorted shopping trips, a weekly club specifically for those living with dementia and their carers, an annual holiday, seasonal outings, befriending for those finding it harder to get out and about, a telephone befriending service, a range of volunteering opportunities, a handy-man repair service and monthly pub trips for ladies and gents. In Spring 2019 two new clubs opened in Merstham and south Reigate. The day clubs offer a 'structured' activity in the morning e.g. exercise, a talk, a team game or a music session, followed by a home cooked lunch and then informal games and chat. MHA are a Membership scheme and charge a small (\u00a312) membership fee every 6 months and currently have nearly 160 Members. They rely heavily on our volunteers helping staff at the Clubs, with transporting our Members to activities, as Befrienders and as Chefs.",

HSRW staff assess each family\u2019s needs and match the family with a volunteer. All volunteers are parents themselves and undergo a preparation course. A volunteer will visit a family once a week in their own homes for up to a year and work co-operatively to enable the family to cope with the demands of being a parent, to develop resilience, and to prevent the need for intervention by statutory services. HSRW is planning to expand the work by offering group work and parenting courses, in response to Surrey County Council cost-cutting many children\u2019s centres in the area. The charity plans to centre its support on level-2-need families who are no longer able to access Children\u2019s' Centre support due to changes in how children\u2019s centres operate. During the year to 31st March 2019 HSRW was able to support 138 families and worked with 271 children, 211 under the age of 5 and 60 older children. The charity has also run 2 volunteer preparation courses during the year, adding 10 new home-visiting volunteers to the team.",

In 2012, our founder moved to the UK, unable to speak or understand English. She will not forget how hard everything was. She had started a new life, in a new country, expecting her first child. She looked for an organization, to reduce the loneliness she felt. Online she found nothing local. She joined ESOL and in 2014 started her own friendship group for migrant mothers. We remain the only group of its kind locally, and have all-female trustees with experience of migration. We hold friendship groups with women and their children, English classes and other workshops. Our activities are driven by peer-to-peer support built between members. We enable migrant women to overcome barriers in achieving their self-defined aspirations. Our work supports families, to feel safe, and secure, whilst also enabling them to feel pride in Southend as their home by encouraging them to be actively involved in their communities.",

Our mission is to work with people who are disadvantaged, in a non-judgemental way in order to improve their lives. We have been operating in Braintree since 1981 and over that time we have worked with other agencies and hundreds of clients. We see a wide range of clients including: Those who have a history of mental health Those who have learning disabilities Substance mis-users The homeless Single Parents Unemployed Ex-offenders Senior citizens We offer many interventions in order to make a difference, these are: Basic Skills education classes (English, Maths and Computer Classes) Life Skills training (anger management, self-esteem building, budgeting skills) Individual Time Limited Counselling Benefits advice Job seeking skills (C.V. construction and interview techniques) Advocacy Service (within the context of citizen advocacy) Canteen Befriending Many of the clients that access First Stop are people that have slipped through the net. Some are unable to read and write, many are not engaging with other statutory agencies. Because we are a small independent charity, we are able to work with these clients and in many cases provide the support in order that they can access the help they need. We provide the clients with a positive experience, which gives them the best chance of making changes in and to their lives and moving forward. Each week we see over 50 clients. The difference we made to these clients included: Many were able to engage in classes and work towards a formal qualification. Some clients were able to produce a C.V. and to link this to internet job sites, where appropriate Clients who attended our anger management classes have reported they have been able to start making more positive choices about their behaviour We helped clients towards social inclusion and become less socially isolated Provided a safe meeting place for other interventions from other agencies- as we are known to many of their clients and they feel safe meeting here We pride ourselves on being non-judgmental and working to enable the client, for some this is over a short period of time, for others this may take a lot longer, and the forming of a trusting relationship with us is a huge step for some. We are able to take steps at the client\u2019s pace, and we often feel like parents gently pushing the clients to make positive choices and steps towards becoming a more active, healthy member of our community.",

                    "description": "Community360 (C360) is an independent charity formed in 1968. We are committed to a vision to build \u201cthriving local communities\u201d. Our Mission is: - \u201cTo inspire and enable local community action to improve quality of life\u201d. We aim to do this in line with our core values, which are to: - provide passionate, intelligent leadership for the sector in Colchester, Essex and beyond; - empower people, groups and organisations through high quality support - -be creative and innovative in meeting the needs of local communities and the voluntary and community groups and organisations that serve them; and - be fair and honest in everything we do We achieve this through a number of projects, including an experienced Community Development team, Community Accounts Service and Business Bank. As a result, staff lead on community volunteering programmes with more than 400 volunteers, work with over 300 community groups a year to access funding, embed good financial practices, recruit their own volunteers, plan and train, as well as network and promote what they do. We value working in partnership and consult regularly with the sector to guide the development of policy, co-produce new projects and deliver services. We also manage programmes that provide fundamental, practical support to the community. Our Community Transport schemes facilitate over 50,000 trips each year and we hire scooters and wheelchairs to people 5 days a week. Our organisation is constantly evolving, anticipating opportunities in our community and seeking to maximise the impact that we can all have to make our vision a reality. As the provider of Community Voluntary Services (CVS) for Braintree District, we deliver projects that improve the quality of life for local residents and enable voluntary action to impact in neighborhoods and parishes. At the heart of what we do is Community Development. We support charities and non-profit making groups to form, establish their activities and continue to operate, whilst upholding good standards of practice. We help them to find the resources they need (i.e. funds or in kind donations), network and collaborate to enhance their opportunities (such as through Lunch and Learn sessions) and to learn and develop with the provision of courses and bespoke training. We are involved in many fora and committees to work well across the voluntary and community sector. We identify gaps and develop services to meet them. For example, we have established the Braintree District Older Persons forum, where agencies that support older people can network and work together on shared agendas to support older residents in the district. We manage Braintree Time Bank \u2013 we encourage social action through the principles co-production, time bank members use time as currency to exchange skills and support. Over the past year 57 new time bank members have exchanged 2000 hours of time to support the local community through initiatives such as a Community Caretakers scheme and i-tea computing sessions. We oversee Braintree Volunteer Centre \u2013 as 1 of 14 centres in the Volunteer Essex network we advertise and recruit volunteers for 200 organisations as well as provide guidance and support around volunteer management and best practice. We have placed 69 volunteers in the first six months of the year. We are introducing a Slipper Exchange as part of our falls prevention agenda. Braintree residents can exchange old, sloppy and worn slipper for a new well fitted pair as well as find out information on support services and community activities. We have already exchanged 45 pairs with plans to expand this during the Winter period. We also have a strong commitment to health and wellbeing initiatives, which we would like to continue to expand. We embed good health and wellbeing throughout all of our programmes. However, we seek to offer targeted support where possible. This may be through volunteering, our community weight management service, providing social groups or monthly Tree-Mendous walks of Braintree and Bocking Gardens. Throughout Mid Essex we work with a range of partners and have particular strong working synergies with Braintree District Council as part of the Live Well Child campaign (addressing childhood obesity and working with ten schools in the district), Active Braintree Network and the Strategic Health and Wellbeing Board. We pride ourselves on providing proactive community engagement, meaning we like to take our services to people. Working throughout the district we understand the challenges faced by town and rural communities, particularly with regards to accessing services. We are adept at working with residents to establish activities based on their needs, rather than prescribing a \u2018one size fits all approach\u2019.",

Iranians make up the highest proportion of asylum applications to the U.K. and Hull has a disproportionate number of Iranians who have settled in the city. ICOH has around 300 active members. We work in close liaison with leading local charities and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) community groups based in Hull and Yorkshire to: - Deliver training and employment services. - Support asylum seekers with their relocation. - Provide emotional support and special services. - Run cultural and social activities. Training and social activities are used by ICOH to introduce beneficiaries to British and other minority ethnic customs, reduce loneliness and discourage segregation. We have already seen more members finding employment, gaining confidence speaking English to local people, befriending individuals from outside their ethnic community and an understanding of British customs.",

Last year we delivered a three month pilot project delivering IT help in the home to over 50 elderly or disabled people. We provided help with internet connectivity and various home IT aids eg.Alexa, audio visual door alerts and audio visual connectivity via skype on large screens eg tv screens or tablets. We provided free recycled computers in many cases which had been donated and we had removed all data or installed new hardware in. We provided temporary connectivity via dongles in many cases and delivered instruction in use of all the equipment. The present emergency highlights the vulnerable people who are not connected to internet services. Fair numbers of people still do not have any contact with the outside world apart from ordinary phones and many do not have or can use smart phones. All current advice and information is via the web and these people dont have access to it!.These people will become known as the emergency unfolds and different organisations provide help and assistance outside the doors but there arent organisations set up to help connect them connect.

In particular, the company focuses on providing courses for young people who find it difficult to cope with the formal education system, are from deprived backgrounds and who face multiple barriers to personal development. The objective of the programmes offered is to create opportunities for young people to develop their social skills, gain confidence and self-esteem and break out of an often isolated and marginalised existence. The company offers a BTEC course in Active Sports and Leisure and has contracts with local schools and academies to deliver the programme. In addition, the company offers evening activities that are not qualification based but are focused on developing on young people's team skills, learning how to relate to others and understanding their role in the local community. The recently delivered I Will Fund financed project in conjunction with the Two Ridings Foundation was a great success and we have continued to provide for the young people using our resources and a small grant from the Crime Reduction Fund. A small group of 8 volunteers has been formed from the group arising from the young people\u2019s own initiative.We focus on the most vulnerable young people in the local community.",

In the UK we run free weekly craft workshops for adults and children with disabilities in Harrogate, Ripon and Leeds. This provides vital opportunities for people with disabilities to get out of their care homes, increase their social interaction, make new friends and learn new skills in a caring, supportive and creative environment. Participants can also take part in events, helping sell the crafts, giving them the opportunity to meet the public and demonstrate their skills, talents and abilities. This also raises their self-esteem, reduces their social isolation and benefits their mental wellbeing. Our trained mosaic artists have an incredible opportunity to be part of our \"mosaics for schools\" project where they teach children in primary schools how to mosaic over the course of 6 visits to the school. The objective of this project is that we break down barriers between the able and less-able in our society, children have the experience of working with those who are differently-able and discover that these differences are not so great after all. For our artisans, it is a rare and empowering opportunity to be the one teaching a skill as opposed to receiving instruction. We also run two after-school craft clubs for children with disabilities and special needs, providing vital opportunities for social interaction, having fun and learning new skills in a caring and supporting environment.",

Before Coronavirus the Hub, was running a creche facility for disasdvantaged parents. We also had a group session aimed at the local residential care home residents, called Tea, Toast and Natter. Also a communal meal on a Wednesday that was focused on our vulnerable and lonely community members, this was being done on a donation basis so that those who couldn't afford were still made welcome. Since Coronavirus the government imposed ruling on social isolation, The Gateway Community Care Hub has obviously suspended these services and has acted as an emergency response hub responding too the desperate needs of essential food items, delivering items to households such as prescriptions and obtaining shopping for people self-isolating. we have created a toy library to address restlessness and also have clothes in stock to answer the need due to non essential shops closing and baby supplies. Educational packs for all ages as well extra need children are also being delivered to those requiring and craft packs. Also we are addressing feelings loneliness and uncertainty at this time through a befriending system.",

Our Board of Trustees, many of whom are Carers themselves, oversee our charity\u2019s aims which are: 1) To have a positive impact on outcomes for Carers 2) To raise public awareness about Carers 3) To improve public awareness of the organisation 4) To ensure the sustainability of the organisation for the benefit of Carers We hold NCVO\u2019s PQASSO Quality Mark at Level 3; only the fourth organisation in the UK and the first in Essex to achieve this. The assessors noted in particular the dedication of the staff and volunteers and stated that \u201cGovernance is truly excellent \u2013 it is a real strength of the organisation in all its aspects\u201d. The needs and views of Carers in Essex are central to all we do. We consult with Carers regularly to ensure we provide the support they need, when needed. We facilitate regular Carer Reference groups and Carer Forums. Carers save the economy millions of pounds each year through unpaid care. We support them to continue to care appropriately. There are an estimated 180,000 adult Carers in Essex. We support adult Carers with advice and guidance and through our \u2018Feeling Good, Caring Well\u2019 wellbeing programme; volunteer-led counselling and befriending; training and support to return to work. We give Carers respite with the provision of day services for older people and activity groups for people with dementia or memory problems. We support Young Carers under 18 with Young Carer clubs and a programme of support in schools. Young Carers may help care for a family member with a long-term illness, physical or sensory impairment, mental health problems or a drug/alcohol addiction. BBC research estimates that 1/5 secondary pupils is a Young Carer. Clubs give Young Carers an opportunity to enjoy being a child in a safe environment with other Young Carers who understand the issues they face. In schools, we help to address the inequality faced by Young Carers where they achieve nine GCSE grades lower than their non-caring peers. We will advocate for a Young Carer with their teacher, perhaps explaining why they have trouble completing homework or getting to school on time, and help them to work out strategies so they can achieve the best possible outcomes. We give transition support to Young Adult Carers as they balance caring with making important life choices including education and employment. We are a Network Partner of Carers Trust and promote our services through their network. We also have agreed ways of working with other voluntary sector organisation such as Age UK and Community Agents. We work with children\u2019s services within the county council and receive referrals from them. We promote our activities and services via our webpage, Facebook, Twitter, local media, presence at community events, CVS offices and via schools and youth groups.",

                    "description": "Skilled peer support during pregnancy, birth and post birth, is life changing for mothers, fathers and babies. Early prevention through the transition to parenthood is at the heart of our work. Evidence is clear - it is a time when people are particularly open to change. Drawing on strengths in communities we nurture the resilience of vulnerable parents during this critical time to achieve the following outcomes: \u2022 The best start in life for babies \u2022 Resilient parents and communities that are less dependent on limited professional resources Our aim is to establish purposeful, supportive peer relationships during pregnancy that enable volunteers and parents to feel valued, respected, supported and socially connected. By nurturing parents\u2019 resilience (and in turn their babies), we contribute to positive outcomes during the \"1001 Critical Days\" (UK Cross Party Manifesto). We aim to prevent escalation of need. Our \u2018Pregnancy Pal and Birth Buddy\u2019 volunteer programme began in South Essex in 2010 to address a clear gap in support for vulnerable, disadvantaged families. Over the past nine years we have developed a high-quality volunteering initiative that reduces social isolation, helps expectant and new parents prepare for changes ahead, increases resilience, and improves relationships between parents and their infants. We achieve this by building trusting peer relationships, starting in pregnancy, continuing in hospital during labour and birth and ongoing during the early months of parenting. We prioritise communities in Basildon, Thurrock and Canvey Island facing significant social, health and educational inequalities particularly families living in the 10%/20% most deprived postcodes. As well as improving the health, wellbeing and resilience of vulnerable parents, we also aim to make the experience of our volunteer peer supporters deeply rewarding. Our volunteers often describe their involvement as \u2018life changing\u2019. Through skilled, regular supervision and extensive training, our volunteers state improved: personal development (86%); knowledge of health issues (71%); self-confidence (71%); and awareness of local services (86%). Volunteers can improve their employability prospects by gaining a level 3 national vocational qualification through our City and Guilds Accreditation Centre. Evidence of learning and skills into practice are derived from the natural volunteer setting. Peer support is provided by volunteers and paid workers. They are trained to focus on parents\u2019 strengths and assets, treat them as equal partners, and avoid dependency by empowering vulnerable parents, communities and families to do more for themselves and their children. A Pregnancy Pal or Birth Buddy is \u201csomeone in their corner\u201d providing flexible, personalised support throughout pregnancy, labour and birth and the early months of being a parent. Drawing on lived experience or shared characteristics our peer supporters aim to provide knowledge, emotional support, practical help and social interaction. Their strengths-based, non-judgemental approach enables them to build trusting relationships with vulnerable women who may be wary of professionals. We provide the following activities: 1. Intensive one-to-one peer support (home, hospital, community) to vulnerable women and their partners (early pregnancy to 6 months post birth, over 120 families a year, up to 2-hours a week) provided by thoroughly trained and supervised volunteers and paid staff. Parents are encouraged to set and review self-selected achievable goals. For very vulnerable women our birth buddies provide emotional and practical support throughout labour and birth. 2. Weekly community outreach activities to meet pregnant women face-to-face (2-3 hours per session, 10 disadvantaged locations). These take place in GP and children\u2019s centre antenatal clinics, Essex Youth Services, homeless hostels, Thorney Bay Caravan Park in Canvey Island, and women\u2019s refuges. We provide supported signposting and opportunities for pregnant or post birth women to request one-to-one peer support. We set-up information stands at Basildon maternity unit (weekly). Each year, we engage with over 1200 expectant parents via these activities. 3. Antenatal and postnatal exercise and wellbeing sessions (100 women each year). A qualified perinatal fitness trainer and health promotion specialist runs weekly 2-hour sessions in 3 disadvantaged locations (Laindon, Vange, Canvey). Each session is followed by an informal talk about pregnancy and parenthood. Attendees make connections and continue exercising together at the end of the programme. We support them to set up their own buggy walks. 4. Workshops for expectant fathers (2-hours, twice a month in Grays and Basildon): delivered by experienced and qualified antenatal teachers. Topics include: how to support their partner during labour; preparing for changes ahead (e.g. family relationships, mental health); and practical baby-care. 5. Informal groups for pregnant women to meet each other: delivered in Family Hubs (7 disadvantaged locations where there is no provision, 2-hours, monthly basis). These are informal information sessions with simple quizzes about labour and birth; keeping well; and becoming a parent. We encourage new friendships that continue beyond the sessions. 6. Video Interaction Guidance during home visits to parents at risk of poor bonding with their babies (20 parents a year). By sharing positive video clips for parents to reflect on, we nurture attuned early parent-infant relationships. 7. Recruiting, training and supervising volunteers (maintaining an ongoing pool of 30 volunteers): we deliver free four-week taster courses each year (total of 12 hours) that enable local parents to gain new skills, build confidence and find out whether being a Pregnancy Pal or Birth Buddy is right for them. Those recruited to become volunteers attend high quality training (76 hours) and induction that prepares them to carry out the role and receive ongoing one-to-one supervision and peer group meetings (monthly basis). We work particularly closely with community midwives who regularly refer vulnerable pregnant women. A programme manager, a volunteer coordinator and a trainer operate the programme carrying out volunteer recruitment, collaboration with professionals, introductory visits to pregnant women in their homes, matching volunteers to pregnant women\u2019s\u2019 needs, safeguarding, regular volunteer supervision, risk assessments, and ongoing evaluation.",

It will draw on existing local assets and resources and develop the current provision by expanding the networks to form partnerships and collaborations across the community and the local area. New projects are already emerging that Project Factory is being asked to support by either leading the delivery or supporting the partnerships necessary to ensure success. Project Factory\u2019s long-term aims include the creation of a hub where it can facilitate both individual and collaborative enterprise, drive opportunities for personal development and skill sharing and embrace a diverse community to promote well-being, bridge differences and develop a mindset that helps build a strong, connected community. The work is multi-faceted and ambitious - on the one hand, Project Factory listens; it starts conversations; it builds partnerships; it grows networks; it encourages collaboration; it communicates - on the other, it delivers informal education opportunities to grow confidence and develop skills; it holds forums and conferences to build consensus; it holds community events to inspire and create joy. It responds to the emerging ideas and \u2018seeds\u2019 and works to help organisations and individuals develop their own projects. Project Factory believes in the value of listening and curiosity, the power of experiential learning, the importance of story and playfulness, the potential that lies in unique skills and gifts inherent in each member of the community- which is evoked through connection, collaboration, communication and celebration.",

The charity is divided into a network of local groups, of which Surrey Sands is one. The aim is to reduce the isolation caused by this misunderstood and lifelong grief. The local Surrey group is run entirely by volunteers, all of whom are bereaved parents, enabling them to offer empathic support to other families of babies who have died during pregnancy, at or around the time of birth or within the first few weeks of life. Volunteers have also undergone the Sands befriender training programme in order to act as befrienders. Surrey Sands is managed by a committee of 5, with an additional 20 volunteers and helpers. Surrey Sands provides one-to-one, group and online support via its trained volunteers on a daily and monthly basis; as well as operating a website, twice yearly newsletter, literature, 3 memorial services a year and memorial gardens. Support starts with the provision of hospital bereavement suites, through to long-term aftercare for as long as parents require. The aim is to help families rebuild their life, learning to live whilst grieving and create their new normal. The group also work to raise awareness of baby loss and to train healthcare professionals in the unique needs of parents at their point of loss.",

The charity was first established in January 2003 under the name of the Holly & Chloe School of Dance and had the objects of giving relief, education and a leisure activity to local children with disabilities by the provision of therapeutic and educational exercises through the medium of dance. These aims were later changed to encompass adult services, and the name of the charity was also changed in August 2011 when Dramatize Charity Trust was established. However, two of the Trustees who established the original charity have remained engaged. The CIC was established in October 2012 in order to operate the Theatrical Day Service from Ashford Pavilion in Ashford Park. Although the primary focus is adults (18+) with disabilities, Dramarize also offers a range of workshops for young people, as it wishes to be all encompassing in its goal of bringing empowerment to its service users by enabling them to develop professionally and personally. Dramatize works with individuals with learning disabilities ranging from mild to profound. A range of activities are provided which will broaden students\u2019 knowledge and provide a form of respite for parents/carers. The Dramatize club offers offer a safe, supportive, and secure environment in which individuals enjoy a range of activities including drama, arts, sports and community outings. Dramatize employs 2 full-time and 6 part-time staff members, who are supported by 5 volunteers and a management committee of 5 Trustees.",

This is achieved through group centered support sessions, one to one support including advocacy as required along with providing a range of information relevant to the needs of carers including national and local policy change and benefit changes and review, advice including information about additional support services, training to improve the ability to care and ensure their own wellbeing is also provided for, along with a number of days out and other activities, including family days for the whole family to participate and spent quality time together. SCAFT supports young carers aged 6 -18 years through group sessions and activities, as well as individual one to one work. Group session provide a safe, understanding environment for young carers to take a few hours respite from their caring responsibilities offering fun games and sports, creative and craft activities, informal and formal learning and days out. For many of our young carers it might be one of the few breaks they get from their caring role and gives them a valuable opportunity to share with others in a similar situation, tackling the social isolation felt by many carers. The One2One service operates through the districts schools, providing weekly or fortnightly individual opportunities to express their anxieties and concerns about their caring role, gain advice and signposting to additional services. The weekly Support Workers visits to schools also provide a chance for staff to consult on the best ways to offer students with caring responsibilities additional support and our staff have been closely involved in assisting schools working towards nationally recognised 'Young Carers in Schools' Awards. The schools support work is currently active in 3 out of the 4 secondary schools in the district and 5 primary schools, with a further 3 primary schools expected to join the scheme at the start of the new school year. SCAFT has also recently championed the introduction of Young Carers Passports to the secondary schools it works with; the scheme is designed to give schools an opportunity to help identify and recognise the caring responsibilities held by young carers; as well as a way of affirming their support to these students. The scheme also gives young carers a visual record of the concessions given to them by the school in terms of additional support; and means that they don\u2019t have to explain their story to each individual member of staff in order to access those support mechanisms. It gives staff reassurance that a student claiming access to a support strategy has the entitlement to do so and that their circumstances and needs have been assessed by the Young Carers Lead. The passport is designed to be personalised to each school and to be tailored to individual student needs. Like a real passport \u2018visa stamps\u2019 can be added to show the particular entitlements of the holder. e.g. that they may register late or leave early, that they may need extra time to complete homework, may need access to a phone to check the situation at home is stable, may need to be excused from afternoon detentions or may need time-out from class to compose themselves if they become distracted or distressed.",

                    "description": "Waltham Abbey is a town of considerable deprivation. One of the 4 wards in the town is the 3rd most deprived area in Essex. It suffers from broken families, low educational attainment, youth crime and unemployment. A considerable percentage of the District\u2019s NEET\u2019s live in the town. The sole local secondary school receives Pupil Premium for over 30% of its pupils to close the gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged young people. Waltham Abbey Youth 2000 (WAY 2000) provides a community resource and seeks to improve sporting, leisure, cultural, education and employment opportunities for the young people of Waltham Abbey. We believe that all our young people deserve a safe and healthy environment, should have facilities which enable them to make gainful use of their leisure time, should understand their duties and responsibilities both to themselves and the community at large and take responsibility for their own actions. WAY2000 is committed to supporting and realising these aspirations by providing a safe, attractive and affordable social environment with a choice of opportunities together with a counselling service. We provide a wide range of quality facilities and opportunities at our youth centre for 2 age ranges: Yip Yop Youth for 7 to 11 year olds and New Images for school years 7 to 11. There is a wide variety of activities at the centre including table tennis, table football, air hockey, games consoles e.g. Xbox, Wii, PS3 etc. Arts and Crafts and a computer suite. These facilities encourage children and young people to interact and socialise with their peers in person rather than sit at home on their mobile phones etc. Various one off activities are organised during the holidays including an Activity Day at Stubbers Adventure Centre, Dodgeball Sessions, visit to the Fire Station etc. WAY2COOK our very popular cookery club focusing on healthy eating and balanced diets is due to be re-opened shortly having now raised sufficient funding to cover costs. Whilst this facility is restricted due to the kitchen space, it has attracted a wide variety of young people including sufferers of aspergers syndrome and autism who mix well with the other participants. The facility was set up in 2013 following a very successful cookery session run by Epping Forest District Council as part of their Summer Programme and following statistics issued by Essex County Council shortly afterwards highlighting an obesity issue amongst the young people of Waltham Abbey. Recipes include burgers etc. but these are made with very low fat meat and are a healthy version. They are always enjoyed by the young people. In addition to the wide variety of activities & leisure facilities provided at our youth centre in Brooker Road, we run a highly acclaimed Counselling Service. WAY Forward Counselling seeks to improve emotional well-being and/or mental health amongst vulnerable young people aged 11-18, with family members if appropriate, together with group work involving younger children to improve self-esteem and self-confidence to lead to improved attainment and ambition for the future and to prevent them from spiralling downwards into self-harming actions, drugs and criminal activities. Having involved parents and family members for some years, with the feedback from them, it is clear that parents realise that there is something causing their child anxiety but do not know how to deal with it. Many contact our counsellor because they feel that CAMHS do not understand their needs. They cannot get help from the local health centre as it has no provision for mental health services for young people and they also make referrals to our counsellor recognising the impact it has on the young peoples' wellbeing and lives . All of this has resulted in us providing a Parent Drop-In facility at our centre to enable parents to come and chat about issues they are experiencing with their children. We now provide this on a weekly basis to meet a much higher demand than was originally anticipated and have developed it to include a variety of activities encouraging relaxation in addition to the counselling and advisory service. The Parent Drop-In facility has highlighted that the parents are experiencing personal issues such as partnership splits and domestic violence which are having a detrimental effect on the children and young people in the families. Our Counsellor helps them cope with their situations and is able to signpost the parents to other organisations who can help and advise with issues such as finance and housing. Numerous young people are tell our Counsellor that they have nowhere quiet at home where they can complete their homework. This means that they fall behind with their lessons, fail exams and their futures are ruined. As a result of this we are now developing a Homework Club. Mental Health issues amongst young people and the lack of support for them is currently headline news. It was recently reported that more than half of prisoners had been excluded from school at some point. Our Counsellor\u2019s work at King Harold Academy, the sole secondary school in the town, has been recognised as improving classroom behaviour and unauthorised absences which otherwise would often lead to exlcusion. Our facility helps to prevent this situation in Waltham Abbey. We have been providing these services for 25 years and continually develop them to meet the needs and aspirations of the young people in the community. Hundreds of young people have benefited resulting in them achieving more academically than they originally expected and giving them greatly improved life chances rather than ending up homeless living on the streets, on drugs or involved in criminal activities as a way of escapism. The value of the facilities and services WAY2000 provides for the benefit of the community is recognised by Waltham Abbey Town Council and Epping Forest District Council who support the Charity in a variety of ways. WAY 2000 is one of the charities based in Essex to be nominated for a Queen's Award for Voluntary Service in recognition of the value of our facilities and the services we provide..",

Our name changed in 2017 to enable us to provide advocacy services to all people across the whole of south Essex. Advocacy is perhaps one of the most overlooked services that aim to improve the lives of vulnerable people. Our provision ensures that people can voice their own concerns and wishes regarding their healthcare, accommodation, finances and welfare. Our service users include: \u2022 People with mental health problems \u2022 Older people \u2022 People with learning disabilities \u2022 People who lack mental capacity \u2022 People experiencing financial abuse \u2022 People living in poverty We support in excess of 2,000 people each year to: \u2022 Understand and participate in decisions about their care and treatment under the Mental Health Act 1983. \u2022 Maximise their entitled benefits, so that they can afford the care and support to which they are entitled. \u2022 Communicate their healthcare and accommodation wishes to professionals and family. \u2022 Understand their personal budget and reduce their debts. \u2022 Reduce anxiety and social isolation and improve their confidence, mental and emotional wellbeing and quality of life. \u2022 Safeguarding them against further financial abuse and recover their lost finances. We employ qualified advocates to deliver our service across south Essex and we are supported by a team of volunteers. We are contracted by Southend Borough Council to deliver advocacy services under the Care Act, but there are many more vulnerable and isolated people in our local area who do not fulfil the Care Act criteria, but still desperately need someone to speak on their behalf. These people will not have Social Services involvement, yet they still require support to make their voice heard and to reach decisions regarding their needs. These people may be older, have difficulty communicating or struggle with their literacy and comprehension skills. They may have a long-term health condition or have difficulties with their accommodation provider. Without our support, they will struggle to reach positive outcomes and to make positive changes in their lives to improve their wellbeing, health and living conditions. We deliver our services within our office in Southend, in various community Hubs and at people\u2019s homes (particularly if they are bed-bound or would struggle to get to our office).",

The organisation has the following core functions: -Development - identifying local need and working with others to develop appropriate action -Representation - ensuring the local voluntary sector are able to present its views to other sectors -Liaison - creating links between the voluntary sector and other sectors -Strategic partnerships - enabling the voluntary sector to partner work with other agencies to provide solutions to specific issues -Support - providing the voluntary sector with a range of support such as information and funding advice. Our core work which supports over 400 member organisations sees our team work with over 150 organisations annually. In the last year we have worked with 72 new and emerging groups who seek to deliver a range of outcomes to support those living and working in Southend. We provide specific support around governance (including legal registration and how to establish a trustee board), policies and procedures, funding (including searches for funders and support with applications). In 2017-18 we support organisations to realise \u00a32.5m in grant income, or which a quarter of a million went to new and emerging groups. We also provide training to these groups especially around grant applications to build their skills and future sustainability in delivering their future work. In 2019 SAVS carried out a dragon\u2019s den workshop where 10 small Southend groups prepared a pitch for funding to 3 dragons. Although no real money was awarded, advice and post-event 1:1 support was provided to each group. 90% of the organisations who took part have gone on to apply and be successful in gaining a total of over \u00a3100k in funds for their activities as a result of the training.",

We issue food parcels and additional items (such as toiletries) to people referred to us by local professional agencies who have been identified as being in an emergency or crisis situation. This includes families on low incomes, people in debt, people who are homeless or vulnerably housed and, most commonly, families who are experiencing delays in their benefits payments. We have seven distribution centres across Southend, and we distribute in excess of 3,000 food parcels each year. Our foodbank operates throughout the year, Monday to Saturday, only closing on bank holidays.",

Exmoor Trim already supply the military and have specialist equipment to produce hospital grade face shields. The Parish Council would welcome funding to help them support this very worthwhile project."

There are approximately 70 local volunteers engaged in the initiative, including representatives from ten local churches. The group is being overseen by a committee of four individuals, who have made an application to the Charity Commission to establish as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO); the outcome of this application is anticipated very shortly. In the meantime, a Constitution document has been prepared, based upon the model template. An independent bank account is also due to be established, with all funds received to date being held as restricted funds within the Baptist Church. The group is registered with the Trussell Trust and is due to open its doors on Monday 25th November 2013, providing support to those in need, who shall be referred by local agencies. Donated food items are stored in a garage facility at the rear of the church and the intention is to set up a small caf\u00e9 area within the chapel, from which tea and toast will be provided to people while they wait to collect their food parcel. Volunteers will also provide a listening ear, and will have the ability to refer individuals on to specialised support and advice, for example a local job club or debt agency.",

Oasis works with over 200 families per year and with families where there are often years of unresolved family issues such as abuse, hardship, and with low levels of self-esteem. Support includes a drop-in centre, a cr\u00e8che for families struggling with childcare or needing additional support, and a weekly parents group offering access to professional counsellors and advice (financial, legal, health, housing and social services advice). Oasis also provides courses on parenting, money management, domestic violence, IT, self-confidence, and healthy-living. The charity is firmly established in premises in Cobham, with a long-term tenancy agreement. In recent years Oasis has had to expand services to meet the growing needs of the local community and to fill the gap left by SCC, who have been assessed as inadequate by Ofsted for the past 12 years. This has meant that the cases picked up by charities like Oasis have grown in number, and in complexity.",

RASASC supports male and female survivors of rape and sexual abuse in Surrey. Services include a confidential crisis helpline, as well as counselling on an individual or family basis. Specific court support and counselling is also provided, teaching coping strategies, how to manage emotions while being cross-examined, and coping with a guilty or not-guilty verdict in court. Awareness raising is also a large part of the charity's activities. Approximately 200 calls are received to the charity\u2019s helpline per month, with callers being nationwide. The charity\u2019s volunteer counsellors are each supporting up to 3 people per week, with individuals travelling to the charity\u2019s Guildford base from across Surrey, mainly West of the county. However, recently RASASC opened a Hub in Leatherhead so that counselling is more accessible to those in need in the North of the County. The charity employs one full time and 11 part-time members of staff, including a Crisis Councillor who specialises in recent trauma and a specialist Family Support Counsellor. There are 2 full-time staff. The charity is governed by a Board of 6 Trustees and supported by 67 volunteers.",

The group was started by a Reigate mum-of-two who wondered what to do with all the baby items she had when her youngest child was finished with them. The local press was filled with stories of economic hardship and the effect it was having on young families. Initial research showed that no one was offering this service locally but that there were local families who desperately needed this support, and there were local families who had items they would willingly donate. Referrals to Stripey Stork come from recognised local professionals such as GPs, Health Visitors, housing associations, and Churches.",

Woking & Sam Beare\u2019s mission is to deliver high quality, specialist care and support to residents in Spelthorne, Runnymede, West Elmbridge, Surrey Heath, Woking and North Guildford. We know that one size does not fit all, and our care is most effective when delivered in response to personal circumstance and needs. It is coordinated and in collaboration with a range of healthcare and social care providers, and is accessible to all patients at the time they need us and in their preferred place of care. Through our services, we offer our patients holistic care, which means that as well as managing their medical needs we give practical, emotional, social and spiritual support. Alongside this, we also provide families and carers with guidance and advice so that they remain well and are best able to support their loved one who is affected by illness. We deliver this through the following activities: \u2022 Care in the community - enabling people with life-limiting conditions the opportunity to stay in their own home, care home or nursing home. Over 79% of our patients are supported in the community by our team of experienced palliative and end of life care specialists. \u2022 24/7 specialist support on our 20 bed in-patient ward - delivered by palliative care consultants, expert nurses and dedicated health care assistants for patients at end of life or requiring respite care. \u2022 Day care in our Bradbury Wellbeing Centre - patients and carers receive out-patient support with wellbeing sessions, complementary therapies, physiotherapy, counselling, clinical care and social activities. \u2022 Family support services - patients and their families can access one-to-one counselling (pre and post bereavement) and peer support groups, including specialist groups for children and teenagers. Counselling is provided at the hospice, but most patients facing a life limiting diagnosis are seen in their own homes.",

The charity's focus is on helping adults living in disadvantaged communities in Surrey and in other parts of the South East. Principally support is provided to those aged 19 and over, but the charity also caters increasingly for young adults aged 16-19 where they are not being supported. The organisation\u2019s main activities are developing the capacity of communities to benefit from learning; and ensuring ongoing support for learners; helping providers of learning to understand what learners need and want. SLLP is also partnering with Oakleaf and Guildford Borough Council (GBC) on \u2018GLADE\u2019, a social enterprise providing gardening and street cleansing services for GBC by engaging and training local volunteers and jobseekers. SLLP works to develop community hubs in areas of priority for the delivery of local learning activities, and also provides accredited training for volunteer Community Champions who then help others within their communities to engage in learning. The Partnership has established job clubs in four locations, as well as social enterprises such as The Bike Project, on which Trainees are offered accredited City & Guilds Cycle Mechanics training. Refurbished bicycles are sold back to the community at affordable prices through the Project\u2019s shop in Park Barn. The shop is open 3 days/week. SLLP is managed by 5 Trustees, and employs 3 full time staff.",

It was established in 1993 and began delivering its services in East Surrey in 1998. ESDAS is based in Redhill and holds a 7-year lease which began in June 2016. It provides specialist community outreach and services in order to relieve the distress, hardship and need of adults and children affected by domestic abuse (DA) in East Surrey (Reigate and Banstead, Tandridge and Mole Valley). Services are free of charge and include a fortnightly Drop-In Support Group, Counselling, a Volunteer Befriending Scheme, a Parenting Group, a Sanctuary Scheme, legal Advice Drop-in, Independent Domestic Violence Advisers (IDVAs), and Self-Esteem Workshops. The Counselling is tailored to meet the needs of survivors who feel unable to access usual talking therapies through fear, long waiting lists or lack of funds. The charity works in partnership with other agencies, including organising multi-agency meetings or events. ESDAS also delivers training and raises awareness of DA. The charity has a Board of 7 Trustees, employs 9 full-time staff, and 4 part-time staff. ESDAS is supported by approximately 45 volunteers. In 2005 ESDAS was awarded the Queens Award for Voluntary Service.",

It is a registered charity and company limited by guarantee, having no share capital. The overall strategic aim of the charity is \"to help people from all sectors of the Waverley community to resolve their problems through the provision of high quality information, advice and advocacy\". Free, confidential, impartial and independent advice and information is provided through a telephone helpline and face-to-face interviews at four advice centres (located in Cranleigh, Farnham, Godalming and Haslemere). Outreach services are provided in five locations of social deprivation within the borough (Ockford Ridge and Binscombe in Godalming, and Sandy Hill, the Chantrys and Wrecclesham in Farnham), as well as at Bramley Village Hall, and a home visiting service is available for people unable to visit their local advice centre because of age or disability. The advice service is delivered by trained volunteer advisers, supported by administrative volunteers and a small staff team. In 2017/18, Citizens Advice Waverley advised nearly 5,800 Waverley residents on over 18,000 issues. The charity also supported 101 local families at risk of losing their homes. Citizens Advice Waverley (CAW) also has a working partnership with the South West Surrey Domestic Abuse Outreach Team to ensure the continued availability of these vital services following short notice withdrawal of support from SWSDAOT's previous partner charity. The formal partnership agreement was finalised in the last week of March 2019. In addition to its previous activities Citizens Advice Waverley now employs 5 Domestic Abuse Outreach workers including trained Independent Domestic Violence Advisers and 1 trained Independent Sexual Violence Adviser, plus 2 specialist Children's Workers. Although the SWSDAOT will be based in Citizens Advice Waverley's Godalming office its services cover both Guildford and Waverley boroughs and are delivered in a variety of venues across both boroughs. SWSDAOT provides free confidential, non judgemental and independent advice to victims of Domestic Abuse regardless of age, race, gender, sexuality, religion or mental and physical health; in which service users are believed, listened to and supported, in a way that ensures victims receive the information and advice they need to make informed choices. It also runs structured recovery programmes for women and children affected by abuse, both in groups and individually. From its previous growth rate it is estimated that the service will receive approximately a thousand new referrals in the forthcoming year. Referrals come from the Police, Children's Services and other professionals as well as self-referral by victims and family members. Surrey County Council and Surrey Police provide funding but this does not cover the full costs of the organisation, which relies upon additional grants and donations to deliver its full range of services needed.",

We pride ourselves on our commitment to equity of services for all and deliver a high quality, person-centred and trauma-informed service which reaches and responds to all people affected by domestic and sexual abuse. As a person led service, our clients have choice and control of their support which is individually tailored to them. We work with our clients and their families to reduce their risk and increase their safety and reliance, with the ultimate aim of everyone living free from abuse. This includes a comprehensive range of services such as emotional support, advocacy, access to safe accommodation; CBT based domestic abuse programmes, legal surgeries, counselling, etc. and access to our Women\u2019s Centre. We recognise the radiating impact DA has upon every aspect of the client\u2019s life and that of her children, friends, family and often work life. Felitti\u2019s (1998) Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE\u2019s) research illustrates the detrimental impact DA has on children\u2019s personal, social, and emotional development and their health and education. Due to the corrosive nature of DA children are likely to have been exposed to numerous ACE\u2019s in additional to DA. As such we provide therapeutic children\u2019s services or work with our partners to ensure that children are supported to flourish in their environment. Our aim is to drive down the incidence of domestic abuse, as such we hold an excellent reputation as a training provider and an example of leading practice and have delivered training to raise awareness and increase the knowledge and understanding of women who have experienced abuse / trauma for staff in the public and voluntary sector, so they are equipped to recognise and respond to clients enabling those impacted by abuse to access specialist services.",

Last year, our team of 30 specialist trained bereavement volunteers provided direct support to over 250 people struggling to cope with the immediate and on-going effects of grief. Our services are free of charge and accessible, regardless of the nature of death or length of time since a bereavement occurred. Our vision is that all bereaved people have somewhere to turn when someone dies. Our values: We are Responsive, Compassionate, Respectful, Supportive and Innovative. We currently provide information and advice to anyone who needs it in Essex, and provide one to one and group support to people in Southend-on-Sea Area, Rochford and Rayleigh Areas, Castlepoint and Epping/ Theydon Bois, Chigwell, Chipping Ongar, Brockhurst Hill, Loughton, Waltham Abbey, North Weald Bassett Abridge, Nazeing and Roydon and the surrounding areas. The following are the bereavement support service we can offer; One to one support: Our team of bereavement volunteers use a person-centred approach during one-to-one sessions and receive specialist training in how to support people in a number of ways including- helping to navigate complex feelings associated with loss, developing coping strategies and normalising grief. We see clients at local venues including church rooms or in their own home, a service which is particularly useful for clients who are unable to travel. Helpline and Telephone Support: Cruse in Essex has a Helpline run by a team of dedicated Bereavement Volunteers trained to provide immediate support to an incoming call, carry out initial assessments and work with the client to decide what, if any, additional support they require from Cruse. If appropriate they also signpost people to other services and provide useful sources of practical information. Some volunteers are trained to provide ongoing telephone support. This offers up to 6 one hour weekly sessions. Peer Support and Groupwork for people bereaved by suicide: Our Drop-In Groups provide an opportunity to meet other people in a similar situation and to share experiences. Many people feel isolated and lonely following bereavement, but we find in a group situation people support each other and often lasting friendships are made. We offer Peer Support at St John, Loughton which runs on a monthly basis. Anyone from the local community can attend without an appointment and talk to someone privately as well as join a group facilitated by two trained volunteers. In Southend we run a closed group specifically for people bereaved by suicide, giving them the opportunity to meet others who have lost someone to suicide, share experiences and feelings associated with this traumatic type of loss. Children and Young People: There is a huge demand for bereavement support for children and young people in Essex. We help children and young people experiencing distress, and behavioural and psychological difficulties triggered by bereavement. Specialist volunteers work with children in range of ways, allowing them to express their feelings and develop coping skills.",

                    "description": "We are an independent local charity that specialises in supporting children, young people and adults who are experiencing mild to moderate mental health problems. We are here to support and empower people experiencing an emotional or mental health problem by building on their personal hopes and aspirations. This is achieved by identifying and responding to community needs in order to deliver an effective and efficient system of community based services. These services include two counselling services: a free counselling service, open to adults in the Colchester or Tendring districts experiencing mild to moderate mental health problems. We specialise in Counselling for Depression in individuals and couples, but also offer Dynamic Interpersonal Therapy and Psychosexual Counselling. We recently ran a course of Mindfulness sessions shortly to give clients who have completed their counselling some transitional support before they fully leave our service. Our second counselling service is an affordable private service available to people living in the Colchester, Tendring, Braintree, Chelmsford or Maldon districts. Sessions are available for \u00a340 each to children from the age of 5 and adults of all ages. Within the children\u2019s service we offer art, play or talking therapies depending on the child\u2019s age and preference. For adults we have a range of talking therapies available which mirror those available in the free service. Our counsellors in both services are qualified to at least Diploma level and registered with the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). In May 2018 we will be opening a new service called Chat with Charlie. This was developed alongside the Charlie Watkins Foundation and provides online mental health support for students, initially those at Essex University. The service will run between 6pm - 10pm to bridge the gap between the current service provision. Students can log on for a 40 minute 1:1 session with a trained volunteer or take part in a mental health forum to get support from both professionals and peers. In 2017 we launched a new service called Futures in Mind in partnership with West Essex Mind and Phoenix Futures which is open to people experiencing mental health and/ or drug or alcohol misuse problems. The service primarily offers a series of peer support groups, called Welcome Caf\u00e9\u2019s, these are open in the larger towns across the area, some are more specialist including a young person\u2019s caf\u00e9 (for people aged 18-30), an Asperger\u2019s caf\u00e9, art cafes and a group for parents experiencing mental health problems. Alongside these are activity groups such as football, gardening and pottery. These activity groups are run by the service users themselves to reflect in interests of the group members and are supported by a member of staff. The service also offers befriending and mentoring service and is free to service users. Our Children and Young People\u2019s team work with 5-18 year olds experiencing problems with their mental health and emotional wellbeing. We offer 1:1 support either in school or at our Maldon hub for issues such as anger, anxiety, low mood and family problems. For young people who would benefit more from group support we can offer group therapy for 6-8 young people over the course of 6 weeks on a specific issue,predominantly anxiety. Our Support, Time and Recovery (STaR) Team offer free practical support on issues such as housing, job seeking, employment support and help with benefits and finance. The team work in the community and are flexible around the needs of clients. This is available in Mid and North East Essex. In the autumn of 2016 all our staff worked together on a set of values that are most important to us and our service users. These values underpin the way we do everything at Mid and North East Essex Mind and we are really proud of that. Our values are: \u2022Supportive: here when people need us \u2022Non-judgemental: treating all as equals \u2022Respectful: showing admiration for others \u2022Empowering: giving others strength \u2022Honest: trust in our honesty",

Our project provides affordable good quality second hand furniture, white goods (with a six months guarantee) and household items which we collect from the local and surrounding areas free of charge. These items are then sold on at low cost to the general public of which many are on low incomes. The sale of furniture helps to cover our operating costs and allows us to focus on our main aim, which is to alleviate hardship and improve the quality of life of vulnerable people within the community. This often includes homeless families and individuals and others in some form of housing crisis. We do this by working in partnership with Social Services, Housing Associations, Women Refuges, Homestart, local authority Housing Departments, CAB's, etc. When clients are referred, we can offer larger discounts and in cases of severe hardship some essential items without charge. Working with Essex County Council we deliver furniture items across South Essex within the local welfare fund known as the 'Essential Living Fund', formerly the DWP's Social Fund. We further support those who are really struggling by providing free kitchen and bedding starter packs, free new carpet off cuts, free sofas and chests/bedsides, occasionally food along with refurbished computers and tables and chairs, providing children and families somewhere to study and to encourage strong families, assisting people to realise their full potential. We give talks and presentations on the causes of homelessness. Any operating surplus is reinvested back into the charity to expand its reach enabling it to help more people, whilst at the same time diverting furniture from landfill with significant environment benefits and one of our aims.",

                    "description": "This project is specifically to gain accreditation of our Parish Nursing Service, to enable the Service to start and to develop within the North Blackwater Parishes, to be sustainable and to work in partnership with existing statutory and voluntary services to help meet the needs of the local community; specifically for those with a mental health condition, including dementia, depression, anxiety, and agoraphobia. There is significant evidence, documented in national and local health profiles, and provided directly by those living and working in the community served by the North Blackwater Parishes, that mental health care and support is where the need is greatest and where gaps in voluntary and statutory service provision currently exist. In relation to this need, the North Blackwater Parishes are currently awaiting appointment of a new Priest as the last incumbent has recently retired for mental health reasons. An experienced and qualified NMC (Nursing and Midwifery Council) registered community nurse who has worked in mental health for many years, has offered her services to undertake the role of Parish Nurse on a voluntary and long term basis (working 10 hours/week). She has successfully completed the Parish Nursing Preparation course, which includes a 4-day residential training provided by the charity Parish Nursing Ministries UK and funded through a small Mission Opportunity Fund grant. Safeguarding adults and children training has also been successfully completed - both NHS and training provided by the Diocese of Chelmsford. The North Blackwater Parishes are situated in rural North Essex and include the villages of Tollesbury, Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Tolleshunt Major and Salcott-cum-Virley. The \u00a31000 funding gained through the Mission Opportunity Fund grant was specifically to recruit and train the Parish Nurse through Parish Nursing Ministries UK (see above). The Parish Nurse is a Christian, with leadership and significant community nursing experience in the NHS, who values and embraces equality and diversity and is able to work as a Parish Nurse on a voluntary basis providing holistic care to people living in the community of all faiths and none. Parish Nursing in England (and in the USA) has been shown to improve social engagement and help to reduce the incidence of loneliness and isolation within communities. The Parish Nursing role has been shown to improve and promote good physical and mental health, through working alongside statutory services, helping people to manage their own health conditions and supporting people to gain confidence and to engage in social activities where appropriate. The following link to the Parish Nursing Ministries UK website explains more about Parish Nursing. Please copy and paste this link into Google https://parishnursing.org.uk/what-is-parish-nursing/ The Parish Nurse role within North Blackwater parishes includes the following: - Enabling people, wherever possible, not to walk through life's difficult journeys alone. - Through health needs assessment, which includes talking with and listening to individuals and groups, the PN service will focus on specific community health need in the Parishes, to focus on reducing social isolation, and supporting individuals with dementia, depression and agoraphobia. -Offering home visits and outreach to those in need who wish to receive support, regardless of their faith or no faith. Longer term aims and objectives include embracing, valuing and building community capacity; by utilising the skills and qualities (and services) that already exist - in developing a Parish Nursing team. Funding gained through the Essex Community Foundation will help enable this to happen. - To support people living and working within our community (parishes) towards whole person centred health and well-being, through health promotion and social inclusion in its widest sense. - Parish Nurse: working closely with the Ministry team and in partnership with the local NHS and other relevant professionals and agencies (statutory and voluntary), such as the four T's, to provide a service that integrates physical, spiritual, emotional, psychological and social health to the local community - regardless of faith as explained above. - Home visiting will be a core feature of the Parish Nurse role, to provide confidential care, based on active listening, onward referral as required and early intervention mental health support. The Parish Nurse is trained and equipped to manage and to provide supervision to all members of the Parish Nursing Team. Support to and supervision of the Parish Nurse herself will be provided by the charity Parish Nursing Ministries UK (PNMUK). This supervision and support is included in the PNMUK accreditation fee. Documents to be uploaded include the following: - Parish Nurse (PN) approved role description (North Blackwater Parishes) - Equal Opportunities Policy for the Parishes and Diocese as a whole - Parish Nursing Ministries UK PN service set up and accreditation process & costs. - Parish Nurse certificate of achievement/completion of C2 leadership face to face and e-learning Safeguarding training. - Evidence of Parish Nurse's up to date registration with Nursing and Midwifery Council. - Evidence of Parish Nurse's enhanced DBS clearance, to enable her to work with children and vulnerable adults, including in the home setting."

People are eight times more likely to die in a hospital bed than a hospice bed, but despite this, the gap in compassion and dignity experienced by hospitalised patients is widely accepted to be significant. The work of ART is focused around improving those last days and hours in hospital for patients and their loved ones. A volunteer-led organisation, we partner with NHS Hospitals to embed Butterfly Volunteer Teams to sit and support end-of-life patients and their families in the last days of life. To date, we have recruited, trained, equipped and supported 106 wonderfully dedicated volunteers - who have made a combined 7,300 patient bedside visits in hospitals across the East of England since we formed. For many of those patients, a Butterfly Volunteer was their only non-clinical visitor during their final stay in hospital. We are the only charity in the UK that is working towards a vision of nobody dying alone in hospital.",

This is combined with mental health counselling and outdoor activities to help improve mental health, as well as cope with other life issues including alcoholism and drug addiction to help the individuals improve their lives, gain social skills, confidence and self-esteem and prevent them from being active in crime or being led into criminal activities. We have three sites across North Essex including Wormingford, Colchester District; Halstead, Braintree District and Stow Maries, Maldon District. These provide activities including woodlands & land management, horticulture, land based studies, animal care and countryside & environment courses and qualifications. We gain extra experiences with the assistance of local land owners including Bevills Farm, John Rix Farm, Stone Lakes and the Garrison estate. Our students are particularly vulnerable, with over 80% having a mental health issues, and 20% having multiple issues. Many have been involved in criminal behaviour previously, including anti-social behaviour and many suffer from addictions. We believe everyone has a right to education and opportunity and should not be prevented from accessing courses due to their rural location, their anxieties, issues or circumstances so the wrap around mentoring provision is key to keeping high need learners engaged and for working through problems and removing barriers that have stopped them previously from living fulfilling and rewarding lives. By giving them the chance to gain qualifications and experiences, become part of a team in a positive environment, we remove them from negative influences and help them build strategies to cope in the wider world. We have helped prevent 7 direct suicides this year.",

Overall Aims of tbsongwriting: 1) To improve young persons self esteem and confidence through songwriting, mentoring and recording music 2) To improve young peoples musical skills and abilities 3) To improve the chances of young people engaging with education and/or employment We aim to work with those that need our 1-1 and group services most, and therefore the vast majority of our young people struggle with poor mental health and/or are not in mainstream education or work. We exclusively work with 15-21 year olds- an age group which is notoriously difficult to work and engage with, yet a significant age for making big choices. We provide 1-1 'Music Mentoring' sessions in schools and at our small studio space. We also facilitate weekly group sessions, empowering community between young people that desperately need healthy friendships and role models. We teach songwriting, recording and help young people learn new instruments and form bands together. As part of our mentoring, we offer every young person the ability to complete accredited qualifications, through Bronze and Silver Arts Awards."

It identified that there were barriers that prevented the community in fully participating in making the most of their lives. The organization has been delivering varied projects across Colchester which address the needs of the BAME community. Delivering these projects has given it a unique insight into both the needs of the community and the best ways to meet those needs. We have focussed our work in the areas of health, parenting and raising cultural awareness. One of the unique projects is the women & girls group called the Uhuru (Freedom) Project in partnership with Stop the Traffik, which has been giving a voice to women & girls in BAME Communities. Our Vision The vision of AFiUK is to equip the African Family in the UK to take its rightful place as fruitful members of the society, and to make the most of the available opportunities in their adopted country without adversely affecting the strong family and community networks that Africans are known for.",

Our objectives are to empower children/young people through delivery of exciting fully supported structured activity sessions; helping to develop their independence, self-esteem, physical and communication skills to enjoy a happier and better quality of life both inside home and within wider community. BOSP clubs enable children/young people, whether they have complex health needs, profound physical disabilities, require specialist feeding, have very challenging behaviours; options to access fun activities readily available to their mainstream peers; whilst relieving family pressures by providing vital respite. High staff ratios ensure most healthcare, communication, social and physical needs are met, ensuring safety of everyone in the setting. Our services provide, amongst others, specific life skills of shopping, preparing food, travel, being out and about in the community. All required by young disabled people to stay healthy and as self-sufficient as possible in their future. BOSP reaches further than immediate beneficiaries of disabled children/young people. Other providers support a lower level need and/or where parent/guardians have to remain present or use less staff. This is cheaper plus easier to deliver as parents remain responsible but is not what disabled children/young people or families really need, being far less effective in achieving identified outcomes of developing independence and self-support life skills, plus does not deliver the respite that parents/guardians we know use to improve their own life opportunities via training courses, attend work, undertake exercise. Our services deliver results. We have proven time and again we reduce isolation and empower disabled children/young people to go forwards in their lives. ECF currently funding our Out and About in Community project ceasing 31/3/20. Successful project with attendees plus parents/guardians making positive comments regarding venues chosen and beneficial outcomes achieved. Monitoring report already submitted plus final report due at project end. Example user comments are: *name change *Jane: initially overawed, portraying loudly both verbally/actions. Became calmer, more friendly, recognising has \u2018more responsibility\u2019 (her words). *Angela: Mum reliant. Expanded network, learning to make appropriate friends, now contented when out in community. *Paul: obsessive about things, unfriendly/unapproachable. Learnt to select activities, built friendships, becoming interested in fitness. *Steve: noise sensitive (medication side effect). Wanted to join bowling sessions but frightened. Perseverance/mitigation plan to accommodate/adapt session accordingly. Now attends. Continuation funding: Well-known disabled children/young people are easily targeted to become crime victims or criminal action involvement.

                    "description": "Deafblindness is most commonly associated with ageing, but can result at any age from congenital or other medical conditions such as Usher's syndrome, diabetes and stroke, or as a result of injury. Robbed of the ability to carry out the most basic of everyday tasks (such as communicating with friends and family, finding information, making a meal) people living with deafblindness can find themselves in unimaginable social, emotional and physical isolation. Deafblind UK (DBUK) is a membership organisation of, and governed by, people who have deafblindness. It is our vision that people living with deafblindness have the same rights, access and opportunities as others. We deliver quality services that give people with the condition autonomy and control over their lives.Through our work, we support equality , independence and choice. We do this by: - Ensuring that people with dual sensory loss have full representation on our Board of Directors - Raising awareness and understanding of deafblindness - Supporting people with deafblindness to remain in their own homes and participate in their local communities - Providing high quality peer support, volunteer companions, information and advice services to help people living with deafblindness live independently, interact with others, understand what rights they have, and access the services and benefits they are entitled to. Our services have been designed to: - improve our members' confidence and independence - reduce their feelings of isolation - enable them to have better access to information - improve their physical and emotional health The services we provide include: - Outreach (our local community outreach service supports people on-the-ground, helping with everyday problems) - An information and advice line which is made accessible to as many people as possible with textphones, Typetalk, texting and email - We make wellbeing calls to our members to let them know that we are here for them and to give them the opportunity to tell us if we can support them further - Peer Support & Social Groups (supporting our members to engage with their local communities, giving them the opportunity to leave the house and meet with others) - Volunteer companions who give members meaningful and engaging human interaction that dual sensory loss can make difficult - Digital Inclusion (supporting people to make the most of their digital technology by showing them how to use in-built accessibility features as well as third-party software and apps). Enabling our members to keep in touch with others, and to use the internet for shopping, banking and accessing information - Accessible holidays in our specially adapted caravans in Norfolk and Wales - A Casework service where we provide bespoke and individual one-to-one support, empowering more people to resolve their own issues, making sure their voices are heard and that they are able to make informed decisions - A quarterly magazine, 'Open Hand' that includes relevant and useful information and is available in a range of accessible formats",

                    "description": "One Community is a home grown, DIY charitable organisation created by the needs of the local people of Tilbury during the peak of the recession of 2008 for the benefit of their community. Our vision is to inspire and support local people to work actively together to achieve the best for themselves and their community with the ultimate aim of improving their quality of life, and creating economic prosperity. We work with the most disadvantaged communities \u2013 particularly residents in Tilbury Riverside & Thurrock Park and Tilbury St Chads who are 61% of the Tilbury population and among the 20% most deprived in England (IMD 2015, Tilbury Community Local-Led Development Strategy 2016). Our strategic objectives are to develop the capacity and skills of local people; to work in partnership with others to promote community well-being; to own, manage or maintain affordable, accessible and thriving community facilities; and to create a sustainable community anchor organisation. All our projects are needs-led and we actively encourage involvement and volunteering from people of all backgrounds. The work we are currently delivering involves supporting the marginalised and the unemployed as we find these are the people who are most vulnerable. This group of people often find themselves removed from main stream activity which does not have many public places for people to meet and gather together. There is currently no jobcentre, leisure centre, pub or bank. We offer a free drop-in coffee morning with a Work Club on Mondays, to support employment opportunities thereby creating economic prosperity. Our community shop is available 24/7 for small group activity for people to come together to do things that would alleviate isolation and worthlessness. We have a project called \u2018Little Things that Mean A lot\u2019 for people experiencing barriers on issues that are stopping them from accessing jobs and getting on with their lives. There are some local residents who live in a nearby estate, who have formed a group called \u2018LinkUp\u2019 to support others who need recreational activity living on a council estate. We are generally seen as a One Stop Shop where nobody is turned away. We also support the organising of various community events like family fun days to boost the well-being of people in the area. Our TLC Project helps to reduce loneliness and isolation by offering free group therapeutic workshops and peer support through volunteering. It encourages participation in activities that bring people together to connect with the local community. So far this year, we have supported the organising of a walk2connect during the month of March which attracted 60 sign-ups with our local MP Jackie Doyle-Price coming out to do the walk with us as the cabinet Minister who was the parliamentary Under Secretary of state for Mental Health, inequalities and suicide prevention at the time, and her partner Councillor Mark Coxshall who also came on the walk in support. This definitely sent out the right message about the benefits of exercise and group activity to combat loneliness and isolation. We had a Tilbury Carnival in July which attracted over 3000 local people, and in August did a Seaside Special Family Fun Day trip to Southend-on-sea with over 350 local residents and their families enjoying a free private train ride courtesy of c2c rail. We run a supported volunteering called Volunteer Investment Programme (VIP) which is designed to get people back into work regardless of their lack of work experience or disadvantaged due to prejudice, discrimination disability, age, sexual orientation, race etc. We encourage peer support and mentoring to ensure we are a community who are helping ourselves. We received a Bringing Communities Together Award in 2019 from Tilbury on Thames Trust, we won the Queen\u2019s Award for Voluntary Service in June 2018, and local impact award in 2017 due to the outcomes that we have achieved for local people. We were visited by Jeremy Corbyn in November 2018 during his budget rounds. We have quantifiable evidence of the difference our work has made over the years. For example we have an average of 25 volunteers who start on the VIP programme every six months, whom we have encouraged to volunteer due to low self-esteem, never had a job, or have additional needs (physically, mentally or emotionally) and other issues. They are usually people who are not engaged thus feeling isolated. We measure our impact by tracking their progress through individual personal development portfolio that we create for each volunteer. In each case 90% report of feeling confident to getting involved in the community after a six month period, and at least 50% get into further training, traditional volunteering, paid employment or set up a support group or a small business. We get an average of 350 people use our One Community Shop for various activities during the course of one month, and first time people average 20 during the same period. We follow-up by making phone-calls to find out if they feel their situations were dealt with sufficiently to allow them to get connected in the community. We also partner with other organisations to achieve outcomes for individuals. The area is now more diverse than ever before with 14% of people coming from ethnic minority backgrounds due to its proximity to London for work, and London Boroughs moving their most vulnerable tenants out of the capital to places that are cheaper to house them. However, this brings its own set of challenges for the people who have been transferred into an area that is totally unfamiliar to them. We piloted a project called \u2018New Beginnings\u2019 last year to support them to get to know the area and meet people from similar backgrounds, as well as from the indigenous communities. Finally, we are a Hate Incident Reporting Centre (HIRC) with trained ambassadors who support people as and when they phone, report, or come into the shop with hate crime related incidents.",
