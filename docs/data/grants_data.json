Our aim is to help prevent homelessness with early intervention as well as helping people overcome homelessness for good. Everything we do is geared towards helping people move away from homelessness permanently, enabling them to lead happy, independent and fulfilling lives within the community. We support over 1,200 people on average every year and as the amount of people affected by homelessness grows so does the demand for our services. At HARP, we are always looking at new ways to help people get off the streets - and stay off the streets. The number of bed spaces we are able to offer has grown, as part of HARP\u2019s response to the growing need in the town, from 174 in mid-2018 to 214 today, plus additional sleeping spaces in our Extended Emergency Service - an overnight shelter at our Bradbury Centre for those in immediate need. we have always emphasised that rough sleeping is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of overall levels of homelessness. Although this is the most visible and dangerous aspect, there are countless more people in precarious accommodation, sofa-surfing, or staying in temporary housing who need ongoing support to avoid and overcome homelessness. And new people are finding themselves in these precarious and often dangerous circumstances every day.Nearly half of the people who came to HARP for help in 2019 were using our services for the first time, and over half of those new visitors were sofa surfing, had no fixed abode, or were at risk of losing their accommodation and were in need of help and support to keep it. This only goes to show how many local people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and are in danger of ending up on the streets. We desperately need more social housing and affordable accommodation (and this means properties to rent, not just \u201caffordable housing\u201d for people fortunate enough to be able to purchase), as well as better support for people struggling with their financial and housing situations, and a genuine effort to tackle the root causes of homelessness.",

We have a membership of 130 charites and community groups that work in the Maldon District and offer services such as funding advice, governance advice, information provision and representation. In addition we also host the districts Volunteer Centre and other projects that support people with Maldon District to be more involved with their community. At the current time these projects include - The Essex Shed Network: after successfully launching the Maldon Shed in 2014 Maldon and District CVS were approached by other districts to support them to set up similar projects. Men in Shed projects provide community spaces with a focus on practical activities such as woodwork. These spaces enable local men to build friendships and gain/offer peer support which has the ultimate outcome of improving social connections and decreasing feelings of loneliness. The Essex Shed Network provides support, information and networking opportunities to people involved with or wishing to be involved with Men in Shed projects - Blokes: - spinning off from the Essex Shed Network we are working in partnership with Active Maldon to facilitate local men having support to access existing local services and activities that have positive health outcomes such as walking football or weight management schemes. - Southminster Patio Project: - working with the Memorial Hall in Southminster we are setting up a community gardening space at the rear of their project to enhance the Memorial Halls offer as a community hub for Southminster and to have wellbeing outcomes for local people - Harbour: - running for ten years this project provides social support to local people who are a risk of social isolation. As a weekly coffee morning it offers access to Connect Well social prescribing and wellbeing activities such as gardening, singing and crafts as well as the opportunity to make friendships. - Wellbeing walks: Weekly walks at Maldon Prom Park to encourage people to walk socially as a first step to healthier lives. - The Maldon Active Support Team: this project add value to all the above and the wider sector through the Volunteer Centre and other contacts. Working in a person centred way the project provides bespoke one to one support to people who have barriers to community involvement such as mental health conditions, physical disabilities, low income or low confidence. The Coordinator works with them to explore options they may be interested in and facilitate their involvement, this includes help with form filling, accompanied visits, adaption of opportunities and ongoing support. The MAST project also hosts some small group activities as tasters for community involvement, these are being merged with some of the above projects as the MAST project comes to an end in December 2018 and we are working as an organisation to preserving the legacy of the project.",

Our aim is to provide transport for the most vulnerable people in our community - mostly elderly and disabled. Transport is door-to-door for medical, social or shopping trips; we also organise social excursions each Saturday and monthly social trips for retirement home residents. Using 7 wheelchair accessible minibuses and 15 volunteer car drivers we are a lifeline to many who would not travel without us. We connect people with their communities and ensure they are able to access all the services available to them. In addition to our minibus services we offer a bespoke car service run by volunteer car drivers in their own cars. This service is tailored to the individual and volunteers are able to assist passengers with shopping or sit with them at medical appointments or support groups. We are also able to offer transport for people to visit their loved ones in hospital or in care homes. Our services are much sought after and we are always running at full capacity. Approximately 50 new members join the scheme every month and we carry out approximately 3000 trips per month.",

We employ qualified and dedicated Social Workers & Counsellors to deliver a caring professional service, which is structured and intensive where necessary. Our unique approach is to intervene a soon as problems are identified and work with the children for a long as it takes to put things right. Mental health problems affect about 1 in 10 children or young people and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives. Without effective intervention, these conditions can have a significant impact on their life chances. Our experienced mental health professionals not only support the child through one to one counselling sessions but also, by conducting thorough assessments are able to provide expert advice and support to both school staff, parents and families. The majority of children we help come to us, or are referred to us through their school and it is a fact that a child with emotional and behavioural problems can often cause disruption in a classroom and generally hinder their own learning and that of the other children in the class. Through our intervention we are able to offer support to the child or young person, their families as well as both the school and their staff.",

Often clients are not able or have the wherewithal or access to a computer for this type of benefit take up and regularly we see people in obvious distress concerning this situation. We are experienced in helping and supporting claimants in enabling access to in order fulfil the requirements of the benefit itself. This is an essential and valuable service and extremely time consuming as more and more folk are being transferred over to UC and then are panicking about application and budgeting the new type of payment. This help was requested by local claimants and by the Job Centre Plus office as they are unable to assist directly with a claim or a setup of a UC account.",

To achieve our aims we provide bespoke mentoring and befriending services via one to one or in groups to benefit both parents and their children up to the age of 11 years. Group mentoring is in response to identified needs in our local community and we reach out to families most in need. Our core work is a Home-Start model of which independent research found 3 years after support ended both parent and child outcomes continued. Volunteers play an important role and offer the assistance of another person to provide both emotional and practical mentoring support in supervised role. Alongside this core work we identify need and pop up innovative projects in response. All our projects work on the principle of building skills and not building dependency with the goals to make life long changes that will support lasting change for local children we support.",
