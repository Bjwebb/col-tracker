Our aim is to help prevent homelessness with early intervention as well as helping people overcome homelessness for good. Everything we do is geared towards helping people move away from homelessness permanently, enabling them to lead happy, independent and fulfilling lives within the community. We support over 1,200 people on average every year and as the amount of people affected by homelessness grows so does the demand for our services. At HARP, we are always looking at new ways to help people get off the streets - and stay off the streets. The number of bed spaces we are able to offer has grown, as part of HARP\u2019s response to the growing need in the town, from 174 in mid-2018 to 214 today, plus additional sleeping spaces in our Extended Emergency Service - an overnight shelter at our Bradbury Centre for those in immediate need. we have always emphasised that rough sleeping is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of overall levels of homelessness. Although this is the most visible and dangerous aspect, there are countless more people in precarious accommodation, sofa-surfing, or staying in temporary housing who need ongoing support to avoid and overcome homelessness. And new people are finding themselves in these precarious and often dangerous circumstances every day.Nearly half of the people who came to HARP for help in 2019 were using our services for the first time, and over half of those new visitors were sofa surfing, had no fixed abode, or were at risk of losing their accommodation and were in need of help and support to keep it. This only goes to show how many local people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and are in danger of ending up on the streets. We desperately need more social housing and affordable accommodation (and this means properties to rent, not just \u201caffordable housing\u201d for people fortunate enough to be able to purchase), as well as better support for people struggling with their financial and housing situations, and a genuine effort to tackle the root causes of homelessness.",

We have a membership of 130 charites and community groups that work in the Maldon District and offer services such as funding advice, governance advice, information provision and representation. In addition we also host the districts Volunteer Centre and other projects that support people with Maldon District to be more involved with their community. At the current time these projects include - The Essex Shed Network: after successfully launching the Maldon Shed in 2014 Maldon and District CVS were approached by other districts to support them to set up similar projects. Men in Shed projects provide community spaces with a focus on practical activities such as woodwork. These spaces enable local men to build friendships and gain/offer peer support which has the ultimate outcome of improving social connections and decreasing feelings of loneliness. The Essex Shed Network provides support, information and networking opportunities to people involved with or wishing to be involved with Men in Shed projects - Blokes: - spinning off from the Essex Shed Network we are working in partnership with Active Maldon to facilitate local men having support to access existing local services and activities that have positive health outcomes such as walking football or weight management schemes. - Southminster Patio Project: - working with the Memorial Hall in Southminster we are setting up a community gardening space at the rear of their project to enhance the Memorial Halls offer as a community hub for Southminster and to have wellbeing outcomes for local people - Harbour: - running for ten years this project provides social support to local people who are a risk of social isolation. As a weekly coffee morning it offers access to Connect Well social prescribing and wellbeing activities such as gardening, singing and crafts as well as the opportunity to make friendships. - Wellbeing walks: Weekly walks at Maldon Prom Park to encourage people to walk socially as a first step to healthier lives. - The Maldon Active Support Team: this project add value to all the above and the wider sector through the Volunteer Centre and other contacts. Working in a person centred way the project provides bespoke one to one support to people who have barriers to community involvement such as mental health conditions, physical disabilities, low income or low confidence. The Coordinator works with them to explore options they may be interested in and facilitate their involvement, this includes help with form filling, accompanied visits, adaption of opportunities and ongoing support. The MAST project also hosts some small group activities as tasters for community involvement, these are being merged with some of the above projects as the MAST project comes to an end in December 2018 and we are working as an organisation to preserving the legacy of the project.",

Our aim is to provide transport for the most vulnerable people in our community - mostly elderly and disabled. Transport is door-to-door for medical, social or shopping trips; we also organise social excursions each Saturday and monthly social trips for retirement home residents. Using 7 wheelchair accessible minibuses and 15 volunteer car drivers we are a lifeline to many who would not travel without us. We connect people with their communities and ensure they are able to access all the services available to them. In addition to our minibus services we offer a bespoke car service run by volunteer car drivers in their own cars. This service is tailored to the individual and volunteers are able to assist passengers with shopping or sit with them at medical appointments or support groups. We are also able to offer transport for people to visit their loved ones in hospital or in care homes. Our services are much sought after and we are always running at full capacity. Approximately 50 new members join the scheme every month and we carry out approximately 3000 trips per month.",

We employ qualified and dedicated Social Workers & Counsellors to deliver a caring professional service, which is structured and intensive where necessary. Our unique approach is to intervene a soon as problems are identified and work with the children for a long as it takes to put things right. Mental health problems affect about 1 in 10 children or young people and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives. Without effective intervention, these conditions can have a significant impact on their life chances. Our experienced mental health professionals not only support the child through one to one counselling sessions but also, by conducting thorough assessments are able to provide expert advice and support to both school staff, parents and families. The majority of children we help come to us, or are referred to us through their school and it is a fact that a child with emotional and behavioural problems can often cause disruption in a classroom and generally hinder their own learning and that of the other children in the class. Through our intervention we are able to offer support to the child or young person, their families as well as both the school and their staff.",

We support small group development in many different ways including constitutions, policies, becoming fit for grant funding, improving branding and marketing, finding funding.

Full assistance with disability issues and completion of Personal Independence Payment (PIP), children's Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance (AA) forms, mandatory reconsiderations and appeals. Whilst not a foodbank we provide and have done for over 13 years , sets of parcels of food and toiletries, loo rolls, baby essentials including nappies, household goods and cleaning liquids to those in an emergency need situation - issued on production of a written referral only from an agency. Staff have the authority to provide goods if necessary. These goods are all donated by churches and other faith organisations, schools and the general public and local businesses. Via a CVS Winter Warmth Grant we provide top ups for gas and electricity meters, in emergency only. We also help with the purchase of uniform for children in an impoverished family situation; these funds are donated to us specifically. We give out tents, airbeds, sleeping bags and chairs to those sleeping rough on the streets and in vehicles; donated via V Festival Clearance and Lighthouse Furniture Project. Also duvets, bedding and towels are provided to those in need once a tenancy has been arranged and where they have no funds to buy such items having paid out deposits and rent in advance to secure a home. We give out what comes in by way of donations as many individuals and agencies both statutory, nonstatutory, voluntary sector, local businesses such as Co-op, Johnsons, Howdens Joinery, Pipetech, individuals, churches and faith organisations give to the Centre. We operate a subsidised canteen serving hot and cold drinks and cold snacks at incredibly cheap prices. Specific Universal Credit assistance is provided, especially with online application and set up and then ongoing via a claimant's journal.

We are experienced in helping and supporting claimants in enabling access to in order fulfil the requirements of the benefit itself. This is an essential and valuable service and extremely time consuming as more and more folk are being transferred over to UC and then are panicking about application and budgeting the new type of payment. This help was requested by local claimants and by the Job Centre Plus office as they are unable to assist directly with a claim or a setup of a UC account.",

Our core work is a Home-Start model of which independent research found 3 years after support ended both parent and child outcomes continued. Volunteers play an important role and offer the assistance of another person to provide both emotional and practical mentoring support in supervised role.

                    "description": "ACSOS offers a friendship/befriending service for older adults; a low cost transport service (driver mileage reimbursement only) which offers lifts to and from medical appointments, shopping, day centres/clubs and visits to loved ones in hospital/homes, a \u2018handyman\u2019 service to provide assistance with small repairs along with information, wheelchair hire, hearing aid battery replacement, advice and signposting to other services and agencies. The friendship/befriending service seeks to provide comfort, friendship and practical help to residents in the borough of Southend-on-Sea and in Castle Point and Rochford who feel isolated or who need support in maintaining the lifestyle they wish to lead. In addition to providing company, weekly visits or telephone calls also enable the volunteer to monitor the well-being of the person being visited/called (the \"visitee\"). This is an invaluable service in that any signs of deterioration in the health of the visitee can be reported to the appropriate authority at the earliest possible stage. ACSOS currently befriends c.300 older people. The transport service provided by ACSOS has grown substantially over the past 5 years from c.600 lifts in 2013 to over 4,000 lifts in the past year. ACSOS receives no funding for this service, the only charge being a mileage charge of 47p per mile paid directly to our volunteer drivers. ACSOS has recently merged with Club 50+ CIO (reg. no. 1152184). The club provides health promoting activities such as tai chi, yoga and \u201ckeep fit\u201d classes as well as table tennis, short mat bowls, snooker and darts. It also provides line, modern ballroom, sequence and belly dancing tuition and offers lessons to help older people to improve their computer literacy and understand how to use the internet. Members can also play whist and bridge and there are facilities for them to develop skills in arts and crafts. As, due to age, many of its members are not as fit and active as they used to be the club tries to tailor its classes to meet their specific needs. For those that are less active and just want company, the club also has a \u201ctea bar\u201d where members can buy hot or cold drinks and light snacks. As most of its members are pensioners and many are on low incomes, the club has endeavoured to keep its charges as low as possible while trying to ensure that it can pay its bills. For example, charges for tutor-led activities (\u00a32.50 per session) and \u201ctea bar\u201d charges (50p for a cup of tea) are lower than those charged by most other activity clubs or cafes. These activities are much needed as, compared to the national average, Southend has: * a higher than average number of people over 65; * a higher percentage of older people living in deprivation; and * significantly more older people who live alone. Older adults in Southend on Sea are also 2.5% more likely to suffer with multiple long term health conditions than the rest of the UK. ACSOS has recently obtained planning permission from Southend Borough Council to convert the Grade II listed, Havens department store in Westcliff-on-Sea into a \"one-stop\" centre housing all of the facilities and services need by the older people of Southend and surrounding areas.The community hub is located in an area of Southend that houses a significant percentage of the older residents of the Borough many of whom are on low incomes. The hub will house not only ACSOS but also other local charities such as advocacy, bereavement support and services for those suffering from dementia. It will also house rooms for public health and social services and provide older people with chiropody, hairdressing and beauty treatment services. The hub will also include a caf\u00e9 which will offer hot and cold meals and drinks at a reasonable cost throughout the day and will be open to anyone. Club 50+, which has over 200 members, will be relocated to the first floor of hub from its current premises in Queens Road, Southend that is being converted into flats at the beginning of 2019. The hub will offer a range of regular \u2018pop up\u2019 services delivered by the Police, Fire Service, Peabody, Alzheimers Society and any other local organizations and charities who can offer services or information appropriate for the service users. There will be a number of opportunities for the sharing of experience and skills through inter-generational activities, for example, a \u201cMen's Shed\u201d will be in situ at the Hub which will offer people (both men and women) the chance to develop woodworking and metal working skills.",

What we do (Our Mission) The Foodbank exists to prevent or relieve poverty in Colchester and the surrounding area, in particular, but not exclusively, by providing emergency food supplies to individuals with assessed short-term need and/or to charities or other organisations working towards the same aims. How we help (Delivering for the common good /public benefit) Colchester Foodbank provides short-term emergency support to individuals and families in a crisis within Colchester and the surrounding area, including Brightlingsea. We also work with other local food banks and regularly review our areas of coverage in response to need. To qualify for help, families and individuals must be referred by a professional from a partner organisation, such as Social Services, One Support, Community Mental Health Team, local housing groups, Citizens Advice Bureau and Age UK. We also work with Churches, Schools, GP Surgeries, philanthropic individuals and businesses. The need for referral to Colchester Foodbank is usually caused by a complex combination of events that may include factors like benefits delays, unemployment, illness and domestic violence. Where possible we refer or signpost people to relevant agencies, so they can get the additional help they need. This enables them to more fully understand the reality of their issues and how to get through them, seeking appropriate support and targeted transitional intervention. Also for us, to be able to monitor our longer term social impact.

                    "description": "Rainbow Services (Harlow) is a local charity which acts as the infrastructure support services provider for the VCSE across Harlow with extensive networks across communities, businesses and voluntary sector organisations and delivers several community projects with vulnerable and disadvantaged communities in the town, including older residents, those living in the Permitted Housing developments, young people at risk of crime and gangs, offenders, and vulnerable communities: - Rainbow Services provides infrastructure support to local voluntary and community groups, holding regular meetings, workshops and publishing a weekly e-bulletin sharing information on subjects relevant to the sector. As part of this role we also encourage the forming of partnerships and collaborative working across Harlow and the wider voluntary sector. We currently co-ordinate 3 partnerships of statutory, private, and VCSE organisations working together to identify solutions to some of the most pressing problems facing communities within Harlow (Permitted Housing Developments; youth and anti-social behaviour; worklessness). We also work closely with Harlow Volunteer Centre and catalyse volunteering across Harlow. This includes through providing direct support to the Tempo Time Credits scheme, promoting it across communities and enabling our affiliates to sign up, providing training sessions and one off volunteering opportunities to earn Time Credits. - Rainbow Services provides direct services to the local community via our Community Builder project, which is currently supporting local older residents to identify and utilise personal and community assets to reduce social isolation and loneliness. We now support this programme across West Essex. We have also introduced a digital element to this and we are providing Digital Buddies to older residents to help them use technological solutions to maintain their independence and social networks. - Our Business Engagement project is working to facilitate a more structured approach to Corporate Social Responsibility and to create a better pipeline for business involvement and volunteering opportunities with the wider Voluntary Sector and local community. - Our Recycling Workshop currently offers 2 projects: the first is a contracted arrangement (with Sodexo) to provide a workplace environment for offenders who have received a community service order through the courts in an environment that is, whilst punitive, also rehabilitative and constructive. This project is the only community and voluntary sector run programme which Sodexo offers in Essex and is creating real opportunities for offenders to give back to their community by building and refurbishing items for local groups and organisations, whilst developing transferable skills which could lead to more positive activities on completion of their order. Service users from this project are involved in a new community venture with St Clare Hospice, upcycling donated furniture for resale in their stores across the region. The second project currently running from the workshop is for young people aged 14 - 18 who are disengaging from school and society and are at risk of crime, violence, gangs, drugs and anti-social behaviour. We offer supported positive activity sessions each week for up to 40 young people each year and accept referrals of from local schools, youth services, the local Community Safety Team and the Youth Offending team. The sessions provide positive, skills based activities supported by adults who have been screened and trained to help the young people learn new skills and positive behaviours through focused, mentored activity for 6 - 8 weeks. We act as a Hub for Youthbuild Essex in delivering 2 Gateway qualifications which young people can work towards. The young people make items for both themselves/their family (enabling them to develop self-esteem and showcase their achievements) and for local community projects for example bird and bat boxes for the local nature reserve (which they then put up and which they can take friend and family to see, developing self-worth and sense of community belonging). Rainbow has a well established reputation for delivering local projects individually and in partnership with others. Rainbow Services is the partner of choice for Harlow District Council and West Essex CCG in matters of community development and consultation, and we are currently supporting Essex Count Council to trial new methods of consultation with a pilot in Harlow. We have been asked by Harlow Council to co-ordinate a consultation into diverse communities.",

                    "description": "Street Pastors (SP) was introduce to provide a reassuring presence in the local communities. The whole ethos of SP is to listen, care, help and to engage with not only those who are out enjoying themselves within the night-time economy but also those who have found themselves in difficulties. We are trained volunteers from local churches who care about our community. We patrol in teams in town centres usually from 9pm to 2am on a Friday and/or Saturday night offering a helping hand to those who are in need on the streets. We seek to discourage anti-social behaviour by way of being a presence on the streets. This in turn decreases unnecessary call-outs to the emergency services allowing their time to be utilised elsewhere. We provide practical help, which includes handing out flip-flops to those in need, give out free bottled water and lollipops (which surprisingly has a way a diffusing potential altercations). We assist the homeless and rough sleepers with clothes, refreshments, sleeping bags or space blankets. We are called upon by some Councils and the Police to set up in areas which require our input. Alongside SP, new initiatives like Schools Pastors, Rail Pastors and Response Pastors which deal with major incidents assisting the Police and the emergency services/agencies are taking place throughout Essex and other areas. A number of our activities include, signposting individuals and those seeking help and advice to local support services and agencies. We take part in fundraising events to continue the work we are doing and to support those in need. We attend and are invited to various events/meetings run by the Council, the Voluntary sector, Police, Charities, local companies and organisations, we then provide awareness of the services we offer. Billericay Street Pastors (SP) was launched November 2013. We run and take part in outreach events at Summerfest, Soap Box Derby, Remembrance Day and the Christmas Markets. The Coordinator has regular meetings with the Police, Councils and other agencies tackling lower crime and making communities safer. We patrol twice a week on Fridays and Saturdays. We have built up strong links with the night time economy venue owners as a way of information sharing/gathering. Basildon Street Pastors - Launched August 2016. With the support of local Councillors, we were able to open a office space and we are also looking to provide a community hub in the Town Centre to facilitate various groups and offer a drop-in centre. It will signpost individuals/families to supportive services, alleviate suffering, help combat loneliness, homelessness and those disenfranchised from the community. We have had the opportunity of running an outreach tent as part of the 'Love your Borough Day' in Basildon Town centre and also Basildon MAYFEST. These are crucial events to heighten awareness of Street Pastors to different communities informing them we are here to help them. Southend Street Pastors - We attend public meetings which includes Love Southend events, Community in Harmony and the Faith Forum at the Civic Centre. The Coordinator also attends the Purple Flag meetings. Southend is one of the recipients of the Purple Flag, given by the Association of Town Centre Management. The scheme, similar to the Blue Flag for beaches, praised the town's high street and seafront for being \"welcoming, safe and clean\" and recipient of the Queens Award in 2015. Response Pastors - Our Response Pastors are active on the national database to respond to national crisis impacting our communities. Twelve are from Essex who work with the Police. Schools Pastors - This is to supply pastoral care within local Secondary schools. Links are well under way with 3 Projects. Two of these launched in 2018 at Billericay School and William De Ferrers school at South Woodham Ferrers. Cecil Jones School, Eastwood and Becket Keys in Brentwood are also in early stages of acceptance. This is a joint scheme between Schools Pastors, Council, Police, Church and other schools. Schools Pastors also assist with being a presence on routes home after school to discourage bullying and anti-social behaviour. Rail Pastors - This is the newly formed Project with research and ground work already carried out by the Coordinator which in turn has formed relationships with all interested parties along the C2C line and now the Abellio East Anglia in Essex. The Coordinator attends the Police and Communities Together (PACT) and route Crime monthly meetings. Preliminary meetings have taken place with C2C, Abellio East Anglia, Network Rail and British Transport Police (BTP) to secure a working framework and joined up services to support the work of this local Project. In-house Training - We have trained 24 Response Pastors, some of who have since be deployed nationwide to support communities with major incidents. We carry out county-wide recruitment and shared training sessions for newcomers, refresher training thus creating value for money. Regular meetings - These take place with the 12 Initiatives based in Essex at Police HQ to share best practices and being debriefed on current activities. To keep abreast of current trends, community/service knowledge and information sharing, a number of meetings are attended which is paramount to the continuation of providing an informative service to our communities and the public: Strategic Independent Advisory Group (SIAG) \u2013 The Coordinator is an active member of the SIAG and now the local Basildon IAG rep. These groups meet at Police HQ to monitor and advise the police on their community activity. The Coordinator has been active at the SIAG for nearly a year and will continue to be part of this group whilst funding allows. Emergency Resilience Forum (ERF) - This is also attended by Essex Street Pastors. The Joint Emergency Services Inter-operationally Programme (JESIP) forum for the ERF is also attended as we are now a recognised body in Essex as Response Pastors. Pubwatch - These groups in Billericay, Basildon and Southend forms part of the Night Time Economy patrols providing a cohesive platform which continues to share best practices.",

Last year we supported over 2,000 people in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Aspire is a founder member of Oxford Homeless Movement and runs a range of programmes designed to prevent and tackle homelessness. We run a homelessness prevention programme which gives people the skills, confidence, knowledge and connections to prevent their own homelessness. We run Housing First projects in collaboration with local housing associations. In all of Aspire's programmes, we ensure that people with lived experience are involved at every stage, including co-designing the projects that we run and in 2019 helped to establish Oxfordshire's first Lived Experience Forum.",
